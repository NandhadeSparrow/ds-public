# Phonepe Pulse Data Visualization and Exploration

## Description
The Phonepe pulse Github repository contains a large amount of data related to
various metrics and statistics. The goal is to extract this data and process it to obtain
insights and information that can be visualized in a user-friendly manner.
The solution must include the following steps:
1. Extract data from the Phonepe pulse Github repository through scripting and
clone it..
2. Transform the data into a suitable format and perform any necessary cleaning
and pre-processing steps.
3. Insert the transformed data into a MySQL database for efficient storage and
retrieval.
4. Create a live geo visualization dashboard using Streamlit and Plotly in Python
to display the data in an interactive and visually appealing manner.
5. Fetch the data from the MySQL database to display in the dashboard.
6. Provide at least 10 different dropdown options for users to select different
facts and figures to display on the dashboard.
The solution must be secure, efficient, and user-friendly. The dashboard must be
easily accessible and provide valuable insights and information about the data in the
Phonepe pulse Github repository.
