## Setup
### Softwares needed
1. Jupyter Notebook / Any Notebook IDE
2. Python
3. Git (with git bash) / Download file

### Code

Clone this repository and ```cd``` into that directory
``` 
git clone https://github.com/NandhadeSparrow/ds-comprehensive-banking-analytics.git 
cd ds-comprehensive-banking-analytics
```


### Python packages

Install all necessary packages
``` 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Pandas Library used for data manipulation and analysis.
- Scikit-learn for implementing machine learning algorithms.
- Visualization tools such as Matplotlib or Seaborn for data exploration.


### Dataset

- Acquire and preprocess a comprehensive banking dataset, ensuring data quality and handling missing values.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset.

## Key Components

### 1. Customer Segmentation (Clustering)

- Utilize clustering algorithms to group customers based on banking behaviors, transaction histories, and demographics.
- Explore and visualize customer segments to understand patterns and behaviors.

### 2. Credit Risk Assessment (Classification)

- Develop a credit scoring system using classification algorithms.
- Train the model on historical data to predict the likelihood of default or late payments.
- Integrate machine learning models into the credit approval process for enhanced risk management.

### 3. Performance Prediction (Regression)

- Regression models to predict key performance indicators (KPIs) for the banking institution.
- Analyze the impact of various factors on the bank's performance, such as economic indicators and market trends.
- Provide actionable insights to optimize resource allocation and investment strategies.


## Deliverables

- Visualizations and insights derived from the analysis.
- A comprehensive report summarizing the findings, model performances, and recommendations for the banking institution.
