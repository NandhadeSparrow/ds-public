1
00:01:18,619 --> 00:01:20,054
Dr. Oppenheimer.

2
00:01:21,589 --> 00:01:22,890
Dr. Oppenheimer.

3
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:27,995
As we begin, I believe you have a
statement to read into the record.

4
00:01:29,497 --> 00:01:30,864
Yes, Your Honor.

5
00:01:30,865 --> 00:01:33,299
We're not judges, Doctor.

6
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,101
No.

7
00:01:35,102 --> 00:01:36,537
Of course.

8
00:01:41,742 --> 00:01:44,377
Members of the security board.

9
00:01:44,378 --> 00:01:48,515
The so-called and derogatory
information in your indictment of me

10
00:01:48,516 --> 00:01:50,049
cannot be fairly understood,

11
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:54,053
except in the context
of my life and my work.

12
00:01:54,054 --> 00:01:56,524
How long did he testify?

13
00:01:57,124 --> 00:01:58,959
Honestly, I forget.

14
00:02:00,294 --> 00:02:02,262
The whole hearing took a month.

15
00:02:02,263 --> 00:02:03,830
An ordeal.

16
00:02:03,831 --> 00:02:06,767
I've only read the transcripts,
but...

17
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:10,103
Who'd want to justify
their whole life?

18
00:02:10,104 --> 00:02:12,772
- You weren't there?
- As chairman, I wasn't allowed to be.

19
00:02:12,773 --> 00:02:15,475
Are they really going
to ask about it?

20
00:02:15,476 --> 00:02:17,310
It was years ago.

21
00:02:17,311 --> 00:02:19,013
- Four years ago.
- Five.

22
00:02:19,847 --> 00:02:21,381
Oppenheimer
still divides America.

23
00:02:21,382 --> 00:02:24,417
The committee is gonna want
to know where you stood.

24
00:02:24,418 --> 00:02:28,188
Senator Thurmond asked me to
say not to feel that you're on trial.

25
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:31,457
Aw. Funny, I didn't
till you just said that.

26
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:32,592
Really, Mr. Strauss...

27
00:02:32,593 --> 00:02:34,127
It's Admiral.

28
00:02:34,128 --> 00:02:36,362
Admiral Strauss.
This is a formality.

29
00:02:36,363 --> 00:02:38,798
President Eisenhower has
asked you to be in his cabinet.

30
00:02:38,799 --> 00:02:40,667
Senate really has no choice
but to confirm you.

31
00:02:40,668 --> 00:02:43,002
And if they bring up
Oppenheimer?

32
00:02:43,003 --> 00:02:45,538
When they bring up Oppenheimer,
you answer honestly.

33
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:47,774
No senator can deny
you did your duty.

34
00:02:47,775 --> 00:02:50,076
It'll be uncomfortable.

35
00:02:50,077 --> 00:02:52,313
Who'd want to justify
their whole life?

36
00:02:57,218 --> 00:03:00,187
Why did you leave
the United States?

37
00:03:01,755 --> 00:03:05,425
I, uh... I wanted to study
the new physics.

38
00:03:05,426 --> 00:03:07,360
Was there nowhere here?

39
00:03:07,361 --> 00:03:10,898
I thought Berkeley had the leading
theoretical physics department.

40
00:03:11,532 --> 00:03:13,466
Yes. Once I had built it.

41
00:03:13,467 --> 00:03:14,968
But first I had to go to Europe.

42
00:03:14,969 --> 00:03:18,504
I went to Cambridge
to study under Patrick Blackett.

43
00:03:18,505 --> 00:03:21,041
Were you happier there
than in America?

44
00:03:21,575 --> 00:03:23,243
- Happier?
- Yes.

45
00:03:27,181 --> 00:03:28,948
No.

46
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:30,150
No, I, uh...

47
00:03:33,187 --> 00:03:34,955
I was homesick, um,

48
00:03:35,823 --> 00:03:37,858
emotionally immature,

49
00:03:38,659 --> 00:03:43,664
troubled by visions
of a hidden universe.

50
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,844
Useless in the lab.

51
00:04:02,182 --> 00:04:03,851
Christ, Oppenheimer.

52
00:04:04,618 --> 00:04:06,286
Have you had any sleep?

53
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:09,389
Start again.

54
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:11,825
I need to go
to the lecture, sir.

55
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:13,293
Why?

56
00:04:13,861 --> 00:04:15,229
It's Niels Bohr.

57
00:04:17,998 --> 00:04:19,333
I'd completely forgot.

58
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:22,569
All right.
Let's go.

59
00:04:24,371 --> 00:04:27,441
Oh, no, not you, Oppenheimer.
You finish coating those plates.

60
00:05:07,915 --> 00:05:11,818
Quantum physics
is not a step forward.

61
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:15,722
It is a new way
to understand reality.

62
00:05:15,723 --> 00:05:17,423
Einstein's opened the door.

63
00:05:17,424 --> 00:05:21,694
Now we are peering through,
seeing a world inside our world.

64
00:05:21,695 --> 00:05:26,733
A world of energy and paradox
that not everyone can accept.

65
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:12,279
Yeah... Are you all right?

66
00:06:13,047 --> 00:06:15,915
Niels,
meet J. Robert Oppenheimer.

67
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:17,583
What's the J stand for?

68
00:06:17,584 --> 00:06:19,218
Nothing, apparently.

69
00:06:19,219 --> 00:06:21,387
You were at my lecture. You
asked the only good question.

70
00:06:21,388 --> 00:06:23,322
No one's denying his insight.

71
00:06:23,323 --> 00:06:25,793
It's his laboratory work that
leaves a little to be desired.

72
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,027
I heard you give
the same lectu...

73
00:06:28,028 --> 00:06:30,563
At Harvard, yes,
and you asked the same question.

74
00:06:30,564 --> 00:06:31,697
Why ask again?

75
00:06:31,698 --> 00:06:33,167
Hadn't liked your answer.

76
00:06:34,401 --> 00:06:36,936
- Did you like it better yesterday?
- A lot.

77
00:06:36,937 --> 00:06:41,941
You can lift the stone without being
ready for the snake that's revealed.

78
00:06:41,942 --> 00:06:44,110
Now it seems you're ready.

79
00:06:44,111 --> 00:06:46,512
But you don't enjoy the lab?

80
00:06:46,513 --> 00:06:49,382
So get out of Cambridge
with its beakers and potions.

81
00:06:49,383 --> 00:06:52,352
Go somewhere
they'll let you think.

82
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,421
Where?

83
00:06:55,756 --> 00:06:56,789
Göttingen.

84
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,758
- Born.
- Born.

85
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:00,593
Get to Germany.
Study under Max Born.

86
00:07:00,594 --> 00:07:03,296
Learn the ways of theory.

87
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:04,398
I'll send word.

88
00:07:05,532 --> 00:07:07,301
Wormhole.

89
00:07:08,836 --> 00:07:10,303
How's your mathematics?

90
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:12,138
Not good enough for the
physicist he wants to be.

91
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:14,273
Algebra's like sheet music.

92
00:07:14,274 --> 00:07:16,676
The important thing isn't
"can you read music?"

93
00:07:16,677 --> 00:07:18,144
It's "can you hear it?"

94
00:07:18,145 --> 00:07:20,881
Can you hear the music, Robert?

95
00:07:21,849 --> 00:07:23,750
Yes, I can.

96
00:08:59,179 --> 00:09:01,048
The senator from Wyoming.

97
00:09:01,848 --> 00:09:03,149
Admiral Strauss,

98
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:04,817
I'm interested in
your relationship with

99
00:09:04,818 --> 00:09:06,552
Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer.

100
00:09:06,553 --> 00:09:08,388
You met him in 1947?

101
00:09:08,789 --> 00:09:10,356
Correct.

102
00:09:10,357 --> 00:09:12,858
You were commissioner of
the Atomic Energy Commission?

103
00:09:12,859 --> 00:09:17,898
I was, but I actually met Robert
in my capacity as board member

104
00:09:18,265 --> 00:09:20,600
of the Institute for
Advanced Study at Princeton,

105
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:23,836
because after the war
he was world renowned

106
00:09:23,837 --> 00:09:25,304
as the great man of physics,

107
00:09:25,305 --> 00:09:29,476
and I was determined
to get him to run the Institute.

108
00:09:39,086 --> 00:09:41,854
Dr. Oppenheimer. An honor.

109
00:09:41,855 --> 00:09:42,989
Mr. Strauss.

110
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:45,224
It's pronounced "straws."

111
00:09:45,225 --> 00:09:46,659
Oh-ppenheimer, Oppenheimer.

112
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,729
Whatever way you say it,
they know I'm Jewish.

113
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:52,932
I'm president of Temple
Emanu-El in Manhattan.

114
00:09:52,933 --> 00:09:55,468
"Straws" is just
the Southern pronunciation.

115
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:57,803
Anyway,
welcome to the Institute.

116
00:09:57,804 --> 00:09:59,338
I think you could be
very happy here.

117
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:01,440
Yes, well,
you'll love the commute.

118
00:10:01,441 --> 00:10:04,143
The position comes with that
house for you and your wife,

119
00:10:04,144 --> 00:10:06,312
and your... Is it two children?

120
00:10:06,313 --> 00:10:07,346
Yes, two.

121
00:10:07,347 --> 00:10:10,149
I'm a great admirer
of your work.

122
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:12,451
And you're a physicist
by training, Mr. Strauss?

123
00:10:12,452 --> 00:10:14,587
I'm sorry, common room,
four o'clock tea.

124
00:10:14,588 --> 00:10:17,623
No, I'm not trained
in physics or anything else.

125
00:10:17,624 --> 00:10:18,791
I'm a self-made man.

126
00:10:18,792 --> 00:10:21,193
Ah. I can relate to that.
Really?

127
00:10:21,194 --> 00:10:23,296
Yes, my father was one.

128
00:10:24,331 --> 00:10:27,200
And this would be your office.

129
00:10:36,376 --> 00:10:38,978
I'm told he's there
most afternoons.

130
00:10:38,979 --> 00:10:40,546
You know, I've always wondered

131
00:10:40,547 --> 00:10:44,117
why you didn't involve him
in the Manhattan Project.

132
00:10:45,952 --> 00:10:48,120
Greatest scientific mind
of our time.

133
00:10:48,121 --> 00:10:50,056
Of his time.

134
00:10:50,057 --> 00:10:52,258
Einstein published
his Theory of Relativity

135
00:10:52,259 --> 00:10:55,761
more than 40 years ago now.

136
00:10:55,762 --> 00:10:58,764
But never embraced
the quantum world it revealed.

137
00:10:58,765 --> 00:11:00,367
"God doesn't play dice."

138
00:11:00,934 --> 00:11:02,501
Precisely.

139
00:11:02,502 --> 00:11:05,104
You never thought of studying
physics formally, Mr. Strauss?

140
00:11:05,105 --> 00:11:07,673
I had offers,
but I chose to sell shoes.

141
00:11:07,674 --> 00:11:11,011
Lewis Strauss was once
a lowly shoe salesman.

142
00:11:11,912 --> 00:11:13,914
No, just a shoe salesman.

143
00:11:17,384 --> 00:11:19,418
I'd love to introduce you.

144
00:11:19,419 --> 00:11:20,554
No need.

145
00:11:21,121 --> 00:11:23,023
I have known him for years.

146
00:11:44,678 --> 00:11:45,678
Albert.

147
00:11:50,183 --> 00:11:52,084
What was that?

148
00:11:52,085 --> 00:11:54,387
What did you say to him?

149
00:11:56,356 --> 00:11:57,791
Oh, he's fine.

150
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:04,096
Mr. Strauss, there are things in
my past you ought to be aware of.

151
00:12:04,097 --> 00:12:07,800
Well, as chairman of the AEC, I
have access to your security file.

152
00:12:07,801 --> 00:12:08,868
I've read it.

153
00:12:08,869 --> 00:12:10,770
You're not worried?
No.

154
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:13,239
Why would I be worried after
everything you've done for your country?

155
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,673
Well, times change,
Mr. Strauss.

156
00:12:14,674 --> 00:12:16,709
Well, the purpose
of this institute

157
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:19,412
is to provide a haven
for independent minds.

158
00:12:20,147 --> 00:12:21,380
That's you.

159
00:12:21,381 --> 00:12:23,949
You are the man for the job.

160
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:25,751
Well, then I'll consider it.

161
00:12:25,752 --> 00:12:28,288
I'll see you
at the AEC meeting tomorrow.

162
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,394
This is one of the most prestigious
appointments in the country.

163
00:12:35,395 --> 00:12:38,197
Yes, with a great commute.

164
00:12:38,198 --> 00:12:39,833
That's why I'm considering it.

165
00:12:41,001 --> 00:12:43,335
So, Dr. Oppenheimer brought
your attention to

166
00:12:43,336 --> 00:12:45,037
his past associations

167
00:12:45,038 --> 00:12:46,505
before you appointed him?

168
00:12:46,506 --> 00:12:49,275
- Yes.
- And they didn't concern you?

169
00:12:49,276 --> 00:12:51,076
Just then I was
entirely consumed

170
00:12:51,077 --> 00:12:52,812
with what he must have said
to Einstein

171
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:55,815
to sour him on me.

172
00:12:58,185 --> 00:12:59,385
But later?

173
00:12:59,386 --> 00:13:01,654
Well, we all know
what happened later.

174
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:03,689
Doctor, your time in Europe,

175
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:05,424
you seemed to meet
with a wide range

176
00:13:05,425 --> 00:13:06,992
of other countries' physicists.

177
00:13:06,993 --> 00:13:08,060
Yes, that's right.

178
00:13:08,061 --> 00:13:10,130
Any Russians?

179
00:13:11,231 --> 00:13:12,798
None that spring to mind.

180
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:14,834
If you'll just allow me
to continue with my statement...

181
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:18,805
Mr. Robb, you'll have ample
opportunity to cross-examine.

182
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:24,376
After Göttingen,
I moved on to Leiden in Holland,

183
00:13:24,377 --> 00:13:26,946
where I first met Isidor Rabi.

184
00:13:26,947 --> 00:13:28,715
Excuse me.

185
00:13:33,353 --> 00:13:35,421
A Yank, lecturing
on the new physics?

186
00:13:35,422 --> 00:13:36,889
This I have to hear.

187
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:39,024
I'm an American myself.

188
00:13:39,025 --> 00:13:40,393
How surprising.

189
00:13:41,328 --> 00:13:43,863
Let me know if you need any help
with the English.

190
00:13:57,878 --> 00:13:59,779
Wait, what's he saying?

191
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:11,524
No, thank you.

192
00:14:11,525 --> 00:14:13,425
It's a long way to Zurich.

193
00:14:13,426 --> 00:14:16,363
You get any skinnier, we're gonna
lose you between the seat cushions.

194
00:14:16,997 --> 00:14:18,063
I'm Rabi.

195
00:14:18,064 --> 00:14:19,365
Oppenheimer.

196
00:14:19,366 --> 00:14:21,400
I caught your lecture
on molecules.

197
00:14:21,401 --> 00:14:23,202
Caught some of it.

198
00:14:23,203 --> 00:14:25,804
We're a couple of New York Jews.
How do you know Dutch?

199
00:14:25,805 --> 00:14:28,574
Well, I thought I'd better learn
it when I got here this semester.

200
00:14:28,575 --> 00:14:32,211
You learned enough Dutch in six weeks
to give a lecture on quantum mechanics?

201
00:14:32,212 --> 00:14:33,646
Wanted to challenge myself.

202
00:14:33,647 --> 00:14:36,148
Quantum physics wasn't
challenging enough.

203
00:14:36,149 --> 00:14:37,883
Schvitzer.
Schvitzer?

204
00:14:37,884 --> 00:14:39,351
Show-off.

205
00:14:39,352 --> 00:14:41,587
Dutch in six weeks,
but you never learned Yiddish?

206
00:14:41,588 --> 00:14:43,822
They don't speak it so much
my side of the park.

207
00:14:43,823 --> 00:14:45,425
Screw you.

208
00:14:46,359 --> 00:14:49,595
- You homesick?
- Oh, you know it.

209
00:14:49,596 --> 00:14:52,898
Ever get the feeling our kind
isn't entirely welcome here?

210
00:14:52,899 --> 00:14:53,967
Physicists?

211
00:14:54,401 --> 00:14:55,401
That's funny.

212
00:14:55,402 --> 00:14:57,503
Not in the department.

213
00:14:57,504 --> 00:14:58,905
They're all Jewish too.

214
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:02,275
Eat.

215
00:15:04,711 --> 00:15:06,946
There's a German
you have to seek out.

216
00:15:07,847 --> 00:15:10,283
Heisenberg.
Right.

217
00:15:19,326 --> 00:15:23,562
One might be led to the presumption
that behind the quantum world,

218
00:15:23,563 --> 00:15:27,266
there still hides a real world
in which causality holds,

219
00:15:27,267 --> 00:15:32,004
but such speculations seem
to us, to say it explicitly, fruitless.

220
00:15:32,005 --> 00:15:33,973
Thank you. Have a great day.

221
00:15:38,278 --> 00:15:40,412
Werner. Wonderful.
Thank you.

222
00:15:40,413 --> 00:15:42,081
Dr. Oppenheimer.

223
00:15:42,082 --> 00:15:46,118
Oppenheimer, yes. I liked
your paper on molecules.

224
00:15:46,119 --> 00:15:47,519
Probably because
you inspired it.

225
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,221
If I inspire anything else,
let me know.

226
00:15:49,222 --> 00:15:50,289
We could publish together.

227
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:52,057
I have to get back to America.

228
00:15:52,058 --> 00:15:53,692
Why?

229
00:15:53,693 --> 00:15:56,061
There's no one there
taking quantum mechanics seriously.

230
00:15:56,062 --> 00:15:57,596
That's exactly why.

231
00:15:57,597 --> 00:16:00,199
He's pining for
the canyons of Manhattan.

232
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,501
Canyons of New Mexico.

233
00:16:02,502 --> 00:16:03,669
You're from New Mexico?

234
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,404
No. New York,
but my brother and I

235
00:16:05,405 --> 00:16:07,906
have a ranch outside Santa Fe.

236
00:16:07,907 --> 00:16:09,742
That's the America
I miss right now.

237
00:16:09,743 --> 00:16:12,112
Then it's best
you get home, cowboys.

238
00:16:13,213 --> 00:16:14,480
That's him.

239
00:16:14,481 --> 00:16:17,817
No, me and horses?
I don't think so.

240
00:16:18,318 --> 00:16:19,786
Nice to meet you.

241
00:16:21,521 --> 00:16:23,689
Did you ever encounter
Heisenberg again?

242
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:26,426
Not in person, no, but, uh...

243
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:30,296
you might say our paths crossed.

244
00:16:31,431 --> 00:16:32,931
On returning to America,

245
00:16:32,932 --> 00:16:36,102
I accepted positions at
both Caltech and up at Berkeley.

246
00:17:00,493 --> 00:17:02,495
Dr. Lawrence, I presume?

247
00:17:04,497 --> 00:17:06,765
- You must be Oppenheimer.
- Yes.

248
00:17:06,766 --> 00:17:09,234
I hear you want to start
a school of quantum theory.

249
00:17:09,235 --> 00:17:11,103
I am starting it. Next door.

250
00:17:11,104 --> 00:17:12,304
They put you in there?

251
00:17:12,305 --> 00:17:13,605
I asked for it.

252
00:17:13,606 --> 00:17:15,574
Wanted to be close
to you experimentalists.

253
00:17:15,575 --> 00:17:17,176
Theory will get you
only so far, huh?

254
00:17:17,177 --> 00:17:19,378
We're building a machine
to accelerate electrons.

255
00:17:19,379 --> 00:17:20,446
Magnificent.

256
00:17:20,447 --> 00:17:22,047
Would you like to help?

257
00:17:22,048 --> 00:17:23,849
Build it? Oh, no.

258
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:25,217
No, no.

259
00:17:25,218 --> 00:17:27,653
But I am working on theories
I'd like to test with it.

260
00:17:27,654 --> 00:17:28,887
When do you start teaching?

261
00:17:28,888 --> 00:17:30,456
I've got my first in an hour.

262
00:17:30,457 --> 00:17:32,692
- Seminar?
- Pupil.

263
00:17:33,226 --> 00:17:35,828
One student? That's it?

264
00:17:35,829 --> 00:17:38,230
I'm teaching something
no one here has dreamt of.

265
00:17:38,231 --> 00:17:40,566
But once people start hearing
what you can do with it...

266
00:17:40,567 --> 00:17:42,202
There's no going back.

267
00:17:44,537 --> 00:17:47,206
- Oh. I must have missed the...
- Mr. Lomanitz?

268
00:17:47,207 --> 00:17:48,475
Nah...

269
00:17:49,809 --> 00:17:50,777
Yeah.

270
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:53,847
Yes, this is it.
Please. Take a seat.

271
00:17:58,852 --> 00:18:00,787
What do you know
about quantum mechanics?

272
00:18:01,654 --> 00:18:03,589
I have a grasp on the basics.

273
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:05,824
Then you're doing it wrong.

274
00:18:05,825 --> 00:18:08,060
Is light made up
of particles or waves?

275
00:18:08,061 --> 00:18:10,796
Quantum mechanics says
it's both. How could it be both?

276
00:18:10,797 --> 00:18:13,132
- It can't.
- It can't.

277
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:14,399
But it is.

278
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,904
It's paradoxical,
and yet, it works.

279
00:18:24,911 --> 00:18:26,012
Now...

280
00:18:28,314 --> 00:18:29,915
Thank you.

281
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:31,316
Mr. Lomanitz.

282
00:18:31,317 --> 00:18:32,584
You're gonna be okay.

283
00:18:32,585 --> 00:18:34,286
Mr. Snyder.

284
00:18:34,287 --> 00:18:36,421
Now let's consider a star.

285
00:18:36,422 --> 00:18:37,890
A star.

286
00:18:37,891 --> 00:18:39,958
A vast furnace
burning in outer space,

287
00:18:39,959 --> 00:18:42,594
fire pushing outwards
against its own gravity.

288
00:18:42,595 --> 00:18:43,997
Balanced.

289
00:18:45,198 --> 00:18:46,699
But if that furnace cools

290
00:18:47,734 --> 00:18:50,602
and gravity starts winning,
it contracts.

291
00:18:50,603 --> 00:18:51,737
Density increases.

292
00:18:51,738 --> 00:18:54,506
Correct.
Increasing gravity.

293
00:18:54,507 --> 00:18:56,175
- Increasing density.
- And?

294
00:18:56,176 --> 00:19:00,012
It's a vicious cycle until...
What's the limit here?

295
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:03,115
I don't know.
See where the math takes us.

296
00:19:03,116 --> 00:19:04,983
I guarantee it's somewhere
no one's been before.

297
00:19:04,984 --> 00:19:06,919
Me?

298
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,088
Yes, you.
Your math is better than mine.

299
00:19:10,823 --> 00:19:12,658
Dr. Oppenheimer's file

300
00:19:12,659 --> 00:19:15,260
contained details
of his activities in Berkeley.

301
00:19:15,261 --> 00:19:18,130
Why would they have started
a file on Dr. Oppenheimer

302
00:19:18,131 --> 00:19:19,798
before the war?

303
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:22,367
Well, you'd have to ask
Mr. Hoover.

304
00:19:22,368 --> 00:19:24,270
I'm asking you, Admiral Strauss.

305
00:19:24,737 --> 00:19:26,705
Uh, my assumption is

306
00:19:26,706 --> 00:19:31,744
that it was connected to his,
uh, left-wing political activities.

307
00:19:34,514 --> 00:19:37,116
You shouldn't let them bring up
politics in the classroom, Oppie.

308
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,917
I wrote that.

309
00:19:38,918 --> 00:19:41,987
Lawrence, you embrace
the revolution in physics.

310
00:19:41,988 --> 00:19:44,022
Can't you see it
everywhere else?

311
00:19:44,023 --> 00:19:46,158
Picasso, Stravinsky,
Freud, Marx.

312
00:19:46,159 --> 00:19:49,295
Well, this is America, Oppie.
We had our revolution.

313
00:19:50,129 --> 00:19:52,831
Seriously,
keep it out of the lab.

314
00:19:52,832 --> 00:19:57,669
Well, out of the lab, my landlady is
having a discussion group tonight.

315
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:59,004
Interested?

316
00:19:59,005 --> 00:20:01,106
I have sampled
the Berkeley political scene.

317
00:20:01,107 --> 00:20:05,444
It's all just philosophy postgrads
and communists talking integration.

318
00:20:05,445 --> 00:20:06,979
You don't care
about integration?

319
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,847
I want to vote for it,
not talk about it.

320
00:20:08,848 --> 00:20:10,315
Especially on a Friday.

321
00:20:10,316 --> 00:20:11,416
Come on. Let's eat.

322
00:20:11,417 --> 00:20:13,385
I'm meeting my brother there.

323
00:20:13,386 --> 00:20:17,456
And how would these activities
have come to the attention of the FBI?

324
00:20:17,457 --> 00:20:19,324
Well, if I remember correctly,

325
00:20:19,325 --> 00:20:23,662
the FBI was taking license plates
outside suspected communist gatherings,

326
00:20:23,663 --> 00:20:25,665
and his name popped up.

327
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,474
Jesus Christ. Sorry.

328
00:20:35,475 --> 00:20:37,210
Frank.
Robert.

329
00:20:38,244 --> 00:20:39,911
Uh, you remember Jackie.

330
00:20:39,912 --> 00:20:40,980
Evening.

331
00:20:41,648 --> 00:20:42,915
Let's go.

332
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,054
Robert.

333
00:20:48,055 --> 00:20:50,355
I want you to meet Chevalier.

334
00:20:50,356 --> 00:20:53,659
Dr. Haakon Chevalier,
Dr. Robert Oppenheimer.

335
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:54,993
Pleasure.
Pleasure.

336
00:20:54,994 --> 00:20:56,762
This is
my little brother, Frank. Hello.

337
00:20:56,763 --> 00:20:58,463
- And this is...
- Still Jackie.

338
00:20:58,464 --> 00:20:59,631
Hello, Still Jackie.

339
00:20:59,632 --> 00:21:01,600
Chevalier, you're in languages?

340
00:21:01,601 --> 00:21:03,402
And your reputation
precedes you.

341
00:21:03,403 --> 00:21:05,003
What have you heard?

342
00:21:05,004 --> 00:21:06,705
That you're teaching a radical
new approach to physics

343
00:21:06,706 --> 00:21:08,140
I have no chance
of understanding,

344
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:10,008
but I hadn't heard
you're a Party member.

345
00:21:10,009 --> 00:21:11,743
- I'm not.
- Not yet.

346
00:21:11,744 --> 00:21:14,279
Frank and I are thinking of
joining. Just the other day, I was...

347
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,614
I support a range of causes.

348
00:21:15,615 --> 00:21:17,516
The Spanish Civil War?

349
00:21:17,517 --> 00:21:19,885
A democratic republic being
overthrown by fascist thugs, who wouldn't?

350
00:21:19,886 --> 00:21:23,955
Our government. They think that
socialism is a bigger threat than fascism.

351
00:21:23,956 --> 00:21:26,792
Not for long. Look at what
the Nazis are doing to the Jews.

352
00:21:26,793 --> 00:21:29,494
I send funds to colleagues
in Germany to emigrate.

353
00:21:29,495 --> 00:21:31,264
I have to do something.

354
00:21:31,931 --> 00:21:34,666
My own work is so abstract.

355
00:21:34,667 --> 00:21:38,537
What are you working on? What
happens to stars when they die.

356
00:21:38,538 --> 00:21:39,806
Do stars die?

357
00:21:40,873 --> 00:21:44,309
Well, if they do,
they cool, then collapse.

358
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:49,349
In fact, the bigger the star,
the more violent its demise.

359
00:21:49,482 --> 00:21:53,719
Their gravity gets so
concentrated, it swallows everything.

360
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,387
Everything, even light.

361
00:21:55,388 --> 00:21:56,655
Can that really happen?

362
00:21:56,656 --> 00:21:58,457
The math says it can.

363
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:01,560
If we can get published, then perhaps
one day an astronomer finds one.

364
00:22:01,561 --> 00:22:03,195
But right now,
all I have is theory,

365
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:05,263
which can't impact
people's lives.

366
00:22:05,264 --> 00:22:07,566
Well, if you're going
to send money to Spain,

367
00:22:07,567 --> 00:22:09,267
do it through
the Communist Party.

368
00:22:09,268 --> 00:22:12,705
- They can get it to the front lines.
- Mary sent me with these.

369
00:22:13,439 --> 00:22:14,674
I'm Jean.

370
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:16,408
Robert.

371
00:22:16,409 --> 00:22:17,776
Haakon Chevalier.

372
00:22:17,777 --> 00:22:19,511
The union meeting
at Serber's last month.

373
00:22:19,512 --> 00:22:20,812
Right, right, yes.

374
00:22:20,813 --> 00:22:22,314
Oh, thank you.

375
00:22:22,315 --> 00:22:24,416
Robert here
says he's not a communist.

376
00:22:24,417 --> 00:22:26,785
Well, then he doesn't
know enough about it.

377
00:22:26,786 --> 00:22:29,388
I've read Das Kapital,
all three volumes.

378
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:32,691
- Does that count?
- It would make you better read than most party members.

379
00:22:32,692 --> 00:22:36,595
It's turgid stuff. There's some
thinking, "Ownership is theft."

380
00:22:36,596 --> 00:22:37,863
"Property."

381
00:22:37,864 --> 00:22:40,298
"Property"?
"Property," not "ownership."

382
00:22:40,299 --> 00:22:42,402
I'm sorry, I read it
in the original German.

383
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:45,670
Well...

384
00:22:45,671 --> 00:22:48,840
It's not about the book.
It's about the ideas.

385
00:22:48,841 --> 00:22:50,575
And you sound uncommitted.

386
00:22:50,576 --> 00:22:54,546
I'm committed to thinking freely
about how to improve our world.

387
00:22:54,547 --> 00:22:56,481
Why limit yourself to one dogma?

388
00:22:56,482 --> 00:22:59,451
You're a physicist.
You pick and choose rules?

389
00:22:59,452 --> 00:23:03,822
Or do you use the discipline to
channel your energies into progress?

390
00:23:03,823 --> 00:23:05,958
I like a little wiggle room.

391
00:23:06,793 --> 00:23:08,995
Do you always
toe the party line?

392
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:12,331
I like my wiggle room too.

393
00:23:22,909 --> 00:23:24,709
What?

394
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:26,045
Wait, wait, wait.

395
00:23:29,982 --> 00:23:32,651
- Unexpected.
- What?

396
00:23:32,652 --> 00:23:34,052
For a physicist.

397
00:23:34,053 --> 00:23:36,488
You only have a shelf
full of Freud?

398
00:23:36,489 --> 00:23:39,291
Well, actually,
my background's more...

399
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:40,493
Jungian?

400
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:44,062
You know analysis?

401
00:23:44,063 --> 00:23:47,300
When I was a postgrad at
Cambridge, I had a little trouble.

402
00:23:48,401 --> 00:23:49,434
I'll bite.

403
00:23:49,435 --> 00:23:50,936
I tried to poison my tutor.

404
00:23:50,937 --> 00:23:52,003
Did you hate him?

405
00:23:52,004 --> 00:23:53,605
I liked him very much.

406
00:23:53,606 --> 00:23:55,507
You just needed to get laid.

407
00:23:55,508 --> 00:23:57,042
Took my analyst two years,

408
00:23:57,043 --> 00:23:59,010
and I don't think they ever
put it that succinctly.

409
00:23:59,011 --> 00:24:03,048
You have everyone convinced you're
more complicated than you actually are.

410
00:24:03,049 --> 00:24:05,183
We're all simple souls, I guess.

411
00:24:05,184 --> 00:24:06,419
I'm not.

412
00:24:09,088 --> 00:24:10,322
What's this?

413
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:11,857
Sanskrit.

414
00:24:11,858 --> 00:24:13,058
You can read this?

415
00:24:13,059 --> 00:24:14,994
I'm learning.

416
00:24:19,765 --> 00:24:21,000
Read this.

417
00:24:22,401 --> 00:24:26,404
Well, in this part, Vishnu
reveals his multi-armed self...

418
00:24:26,405 --> 00:24:27,540
No.

419
00:24:28,641 --> 00:24:30,343
Read the words.

420
00:24:33,846 --> 00:24:36,249
"And now I am become Death."

421
00:24:42,154 --> 00:24:44,056
"The destroyer of worlds."

422
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,922
This'll do.

423
00:25:22,228 --> 00:25:24,029
It'll break before dawn.

424
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:27,600
Air cools overnight.
Just before dawn, it breaks.

425
00:25:29,435 --> 00:25:31,270
Come on. Come on.

426
00:25:38,044 --> 00:25:40,145
So...

427
00:25:40,146 --> 00:25:41,513
I'm getting married.

428
00:25:41,514 --> 00:25:43,949
- Frank. Congratulations.
- Thank you.

429
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:45,083
To Jackie?

430
00:25:45,084 --> 00:25:47,652
Yeah, to Jackie.

431
00:25:47,653 --> 00:25:49,120
The waitress.

432
00:25:49,121 --> 00:25:50,522
Oppie, you're right.
It's lettin' up.

433
00:25:50,523 --> 00:25:52,457
I'm gonna go see
if there's any stars.

434
00:25:52,458 --> 00:25:55,093
All your talk
about the common man,

435
00:25:55,094 --> 00:25:57,596
but Jackie's not good enough
for you, hmm?

436
00:25:57,597 --> 00:26:00,165
We join the Party, and you
can't hide your disapproval, why?

437
00:26:00,166 --> 00:26:02,200
Is that because that's
supposed to be your thing?

438
00:26:02,201 --> 00:26:03,902
I haven't joined the Party, Frank.

439
00:26:03,903 --> 00:26:06,338
And I don't think she should
have convinced you to either.

440
00:26:06,339 --> 00:26:08,039
Half of the faculty
is communist.

441
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,308
Not that half.

442
00:26:10,476 --> 00:26:13,278
I'm your brother, Frank,
and I want you to be cautious.

443
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,348
And I want to wring your neck.

444
00:26:17,049 --> 00:26:20,486
I won't live my life
afraid to make a mistake.

445
00:26:22,221 --> 00:26:25,357
You're happy, I'm happy.

446
00:26:25,358 --> 00:26:28,427
So then I'm happy you're happy
that I'm happy.

447
00:26:33,032 --> 00:26:36,501
I feel like I could see one of those
dark stars that you're working on.

448
00:26:36,502 --> 00:26:39,671
You can't.
That's the whole point.

449
00:26:39,672 --> 00:26:41,707
Their gravity swallows light.

450
00:26:42,508 --> 00:26:45,111
It's like a kind of hole
in space.

451
00:26:45,878 --> 00:26:47,078
Is Frank okay?

452
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:50,082
Yes. He just has
a shitty brother.

453
00:26:50,816 --> 00:26:52,351
It is special here.

454
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,222
When I was a kid,

455
00:26:57,223 --> 00:26:59,258
I thought if I could find a way

456
00:27:00,326 --> 00:27:04,696
to combine physics
and New Mexico,

457
00:27:04,697 --> 00:27:06,499
my life would be perfect.

458
00:27:08,234 --> 00:27:10,835
Little remote for that. Yes.

459
00:27:10,836 --> 00:27:13,104
Let's get some sleep.

460
00:27:13,105 --> 00:27:17,376
That mesa we saw today, one
of my favorite places in the world.

461
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:19,778
Tomorrow we'll climb it.

462
00:27:19,779 --> 00:27:21,313
What's it called?

463
00:27:22,114 --> 00:27:24,150
Los Alamos.

464
00:27:27,353 --> 00:27:29,422
I didn't expect
to see you today.

465
00:27:30,556 --> 00:27:32,525
Do I have to
make an appointment?

466
00:27:34,293 --> 00:27:37,163
- Hey! Hey, get back here!
- Alvarez?

467
00:27:43,302 --> 00:27:46,137
Oppie! Oppie!

468
00:27:46,138 --> 00:27:48,139
What? What is it?

469
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,808
They've done it.
They've done it.

470
00:27:49,809 --> 00:27:53,179
Hahn and Strassmann in Germany.
They split the uranium nucleus.

471
00:27:54,213 --> 00:27:55,748
How?

472
00:27:56,916 --> 00:27:58,616
Bombarded it with neutrons.

473
00:27:58,617 --> 00:28:01,619
It's a nuclear fission. They
did it, they split the atom.

474
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,122
It's not possible.

475
00:28:09,295 --> 00:28:11,163
I'm gonna try to reproduce it.

476
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:19,738
See? Can't be done.

477
00:28:20,906 --> 00:28:22,308
Very elegant.

478
00:28:22,875 --> 00:28:24,142
Quite clear.

479
00:28:24,143 --> 00:28:26,479
There's just one problem.
Where?

480
00:28:26,979 --> 00:28:28,247
Next door.

481
00:28:28,781 --> 00:28:30,216
Alvarez did it.

482
00:28:30,783 --> 00:28:32,684
But then look,

483
00:28:32,685 --> 00:28:35,920
these fission pulses,
they're massive.

484
00:28:35,921 --> 00:28:39,524
I've seen 30 of these
in the past ten minutes.

485
00:28:39,525 --> 00:28:42,394
Theory will take you
only so far.

486
00:28:43,996 --> 00:28:46,197
During the process,

487
00:28:46,198 --> 00:28:50,769
extra neutrons boil off, which could
be used to split other uranium atoms.

488
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:53,905
Chain reaction. You're
thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?

489
00:28:53,906 --> 00:28:56,941
You, me and every other
physicist around the world

490
00:28:56,942 --> 00:28:59,010
who's seen the news.

491
00:28:59,011 --> 00:29:01,080
What?
What are we all thinking?

492
00:29:01,881 --> 00:29:04,617
A bomb, Alvarez.

493
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:07,186
A bomb.

494
00:29:08,354 --> 00:29:10,589
I told you, Robert,
no more fucking flowers.

495
00:29:12,124 --> 00:29:15,628
I don't understand what you want
from me. I don't want anything from you.

496
00:29:16,862 --> 00:29:20,766
Well, you say that and then
you call. Well, don't answer.

497
00:29:21,934 --> 00:29:23,402
I'll always answer.

498
00:29:28,541 --> 00:29:31,610
Fine. Just no more flowers.

499
00:29:33,245 --> 00:29:34,713
You're not coming?

500
00:29:36,415 --> 00:29:38,751
You have to know
when you're beaten, Robert.

501
00:29:41,086 --> 00:29:42,720
It's not that simple, Hoke.

502
00:29:42,721 --> 00:29:45,089
- Chevalier, good to see you.
- F-A-E-C-T! F-A-E-C-T!

503
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:48,626
Barbara, good to see you, and
the illustrious Dr. Oppenheimer.

504
00:29:48,627 --> 00:29:50,628
I'm Eltenton. Pleasure.

505
00:29:50,629 --> 00:29:52,096
Please, please.

506
00:29:52,097 --> 00:29:55,433
Might you say a word about
organized labor on campuses, yes?

507
00:29:55,434 --> 00:29:57,035
Coming through!
Coming through.

508
00:29:57,036 --> 00:29:58,536
I work at Shell.

509
00:29:58,537 --> 00:30:00,638
We've signed up chemists,
we signed up engineers,

510
00:30:00,639 --> 00:30:02,507
so why not scientists
in academia?

511
00:30:02,508 --> 00:30:07,546
Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!
Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!

512
00:30:16,455 --> 00:30:18,623
Teachers are unionized.

513
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:21,392
- Why not professors?
- Don't you have somewhere to be?

514
00:30:21,393 --> 00:30:24,095
Lawrence,
academics have rights too.

515
00:30:24,096 --> 00:30:26,264
Look, it's not that.
I've got a group coming.

516
00:30:26,265 --> 00:30:28,199
Oh. I'll sit in.

517
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,501
Not this one.

518
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:39,545
Richard. Dr. Bush.
What brings you two up north?

519
00:30:48,554 --> 00:30:51,724
Richard, you tell Ruth I'll be
down to Pasadena Thursday.

520
00:31:01,534 --> 00:31:03,902
Your paper on black holes is in!

521
00:31:05,404 --> 00:31:07,305
Where's Hartland?

522
00:31:07,306 --> 00:31:09,240
Get Hartland. Get Hartland.

523
00:31:09,241 --> 00:31:13,212
September 1st, 1939. The
world's gonna remember this day.

524
00:31:14,546 --> 00:31:16,614
Oh, Hartland.
Our paper, it's in print.

525
00:31:16,615 --> 00:31:18,784
We've been upstaged.

526
00:31:21,787 --> 00:31:23,621
During the Battle of Britain,

527
00:31:23,622 --> 00:31:26,624
I found myself
increasingly out of sympathy

528
00:31:26,625 --> 00:31:30,795
with the policy of neutrality
that communists advocated.

529
00:31:30,796 --> 00:31:33,932
But after Hitler invaded Russia
and we became allies,

530
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:36,668
these communist sympathies,
did they return?

531
00:31:36,669 --> 00:31:38,102
No.

532
00:31:38,103 --> 00:31:42,307
I need to make clear
that my changing views on Russia

533
00:31:42,308 --> 00:31:45,877
did not mean a sharp break from
those who held different views.

534
00:31:45,878 --> 00:31:48,379
For a year or two,
and during a previous marriage,

535
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:51,817
my wife Kitty had been
a Communist Party member.

536
00:31:55,621 --> 00:31:57,755
This way. This is where
I keep the good stuff.

537
00:31:57,756 --> 00:31:59,657
I thought this was
the Tolmans' house.

538
00:31:59,658 --> 00:32:01,659
I live with them
while I'm at Caltech.

539
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:04,863
- Do you two need anything?
- We're good, Ruthie.

540
00:32:06,031 --> 00:32:08,633
So, you're a biologist.

541
00:32:08,634 --> 00:32:11,869
Well, somehow I have
graduated to housewife.

542
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:16,207
Can you explain quantum
mechanics to me? Seems baffling.

543
00:32:16,208 --> 00:32:17,876
Yes, it is.

544
00:32:19,178 --> 00:32:22,748
Well, this glass, this drink,

545
00:32:23,616 --> 00:32:27,586
this countertop, uh, our bodies,

546
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:30,356
all of it.

547
00:32:31,357 --> 00:32:33,424
It's mostly empty space.

548
00:32:33,425 --> 00:32:36,761
Groupings of tiny energy waves
bound together.

549
00:32:36,762 --> 00:32:37,996
By what?

550
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:41,265
Forces of attraction
strong enough to convince us

551
00:32:41,266 --> 00:32:46,305
that matter is solid, stop my
body passing through yours.

552
00:32:58,651 --> 00:33:00,519
You're married to Dr. Harrison.

553
00:33:00,953 --> 00:33:01,954
Not very.

554
00:33:04,123 --> 00:33:07,692
There is someone that I feel...

555
00:33:07,693 --> 00:33:09,227
Does she feel the same way?

556
00:33:09,228 --> 00:33:10,796
Sometimes.

557
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:13,031
Not enough.

558
00:33:14,266 --> 00:33:16,968
You know,
I'm going to New Mexico.

559
00:33:16,969 --> 00:33:20,305
To my ranch, with friends.
You should come.

560
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:23,307
I meant with your husband.

561
00:33:23,308 --> 00:33:24,542
Yes, you did.

562
00:33:24,543 --> 00:33:25,610
'Cause you know it won't make

563
00:33:25,611 --> 00:33:27,780
a bit of difference.

564
00:33:31,283 --> 00:33:33,151
Why did you marry him?

565
00:33:33,152 --> 00:33:36,555
I was lost and he was kind.

566
00:33:38,791 --> 00:33:39,758
Lost?

567
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:41,959
Well, my previous husband
had died,

568
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:45,363
and at 28 I wasn't really ready
to be a widow.

569
00:33:45,364 --> 00:33:46,798
Who was your first husband?

570
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:50,201
Nobody. But my second
husband was Joe Dallet.

571
00:33:50,202 --> 00:33:52,603
He was, um, from money, like me,

572
00:33:52,604 --> 00:33:56,274
but he was a union organizer
in Youngstown, Ohio.

573
00:33:56,275 --> 00:33:57,442
Fell hard.

574
00:33:57,443 --> 00:33:58,876
How hard?

575
00:33:58,877 --> 00:34:00,445
Hard enough to spend
the next four years

576
00:34:00,446 --> 00:34:01,879
living off beans and pancakes,

577
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:04,649
handing out the Daily Worker
at factory gates.

578
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:07,552
By 36, I just told Joe
I couldn't take it anymore.

579
00:34:07,553 --> 00:34:10,221
Quit the Party. A year
later, I wanted him back.

580
00:34:10,222 --> 00:34:12,690
Him, not the Daily Worker.

581
00:34:12,691 --> 00:34:14,892
He said, "Swell, I'll meet
you on my way to Spain."

582
00:34:14,893 --> 00:34:16,627
He went to fight
for the Loyalists?

583
00:34:16,628 --> 00:34:19,765
And then he went to the
brigades and I waited, and...

584
00:34:21,066 --> 00:34:25,403
Joe got himself killed first time he
popped his head outta the trench.

585
00:34:25,404 --> 00:34:27,772
Ideology got Joe killed.
For nothing.

586
00:34:27,773 --> 00:34:29,474
Spanish Republic isn't nothing.

587
00:34:29,475 --> 00:34:32,743
My husband offered both our
futures to stop one fascist bullet

588
00:34:32,744 --> 00:34:35,147
from embedding itself
in a mudbank.

589
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:38,382
That's the definition
of nothing.

590
00:34:38,383 --> 00:34:40,552
Seems a little reductive. Pragmatic.

591
00:34:42,354 --> 00:34:43,822
Now here I am.

592
00:34:46,291 --> 00:34:48,794
Wherever the hell this is.

593
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:57,769
I didn't want you to hear it
from anyone else.

594
00:35:00,506 --> 00:35:02,508
Least you didn't
bring me flowers.

595
00:35:09,948 --> 00:35:12,718
We both know
I'm not what you want, Jean.

596
00:35:13,652 --> 00:35:15,921
Yeah, but it's a door closing.

597
00:35:16,455 --> 00:35:17,689
No.

598
00:35:19,358 --> 00:35:21,627
Not as far as I'm concerned, no.

599
00:35:22,928 --> 00:35:25,196
You knocked her up.
Fast work.

600
00:35:25,197 --> 00:35:28,132
Can't keep a good man down.

601
00:35:28,133 --> 00:35:29,567
I meant her.

602
00:35:29,568 --> 00:35:33,437
She knew what she wanted.
What about the husband?

603
00:35:33,438 --> 00:35:34,839
We talked.

604
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,240
They're getting a divorce

605
00:35:36,241 --> 00:35:40,511
so we can get married
before she starts showing.

606
00:35:40,512 --> 00:35:42,180
How civilized.

607
00:35:43,916 --> 00:35:46,984
You idiot.
This is your community.

608
00:35:46,985 --> 00:35:50,355
You think the rules don't apply
to the golden boy?

609
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:53,224
Brilliance makes up for a lot.

610
00:35:53,225 --> 00:35:57,462
Don't alienate the only people in
the world that understand what you do.

611
00:35:58,664 --> 00:36:00,198
One day you might need them.

612
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:02,900
F-A-E-C-T! F-A-E-C-T!

613
00:36:02,901 --> 00:36:05,169
The Federation of Architects, Engineers,

614
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:07,539
Chemists and Technicians.

615
00:36:13,812 --> 00:36:17,348
- Lomanitz, what do you get paid a month?
- That's not the point, Lawrence.

616
00:36:17,349 --> 00:36:22,387
What do any of you have in common
with farm laborers and dock workers?

617
00:36:22,521 --> 00:36:23,922
Plenty.

618
00:36:24,823 --> 00:36:27,092
Everybody out. Now!

619
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:32,831
Not you.

620
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:40,338
What are you doing?

621
00:36:40,339 --> 00:36:43,474
It's a trade union.
Filled with communists.

622
00:36:43,475 --> 00:36:45,309
So? I haven't
joined the Party.

623
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:48,879
They won't let me bring you onto
the project because of this shit.

624
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,249
They won't even let me tell you
what the project is.

625
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:54,151
Oh, I know what the
project is. Oh, really?

626
00:36:54,152 --> 00:36:56,921
We've all heard about Einstein
and Szilard's letter to Roosevelt

627
00:36:56,922 --> 00:36:58,489
warning him the Germans
could make a bomb,

628
00:36:58,490 --> 00:37:02,193
and I know what it means
for the Nazis to have a bomb.

629
00:37:02,194 --> 00:37:03,561
And I don't?

630
00:37:03,562 --> 00:37:06,664
It's not your people
they're herding into camps.

631
00:37:06,665 --> 00:37:08,366
It's mine.

632
00:37:08,367 --> 00:37:11,103
You think that I tell them
about your politics.

633
00:37:12,905 --> 00:37:14,739
The next time you're
coming home from a meeting,

634
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:16,607
why don't you take a look
in the rearview mirror?

635
00:37:16,608 --> 00:37:21,646
Listen to the sounds on your phone
line and stop being so goddamn naive.

636
00:37:22,981 --> 00:37:24,615
Why would they care what I do?

637
00:37:24,616 --> 00:37:26,851
Because you're not
just self-important,

638
00:37:26,852 --> 00:37:29,021
you're actually important.

639
00:37:32,324 --> 00:37:33,558
Okay.

640
00:37:34,793 --> 00:37:37,528
I get it. If you could
just be a little more...

641
00:37:37,529 --> 00:37:39,030
Pragmatic.

642
00:37:39,031 --> 00:37:40,765
I'll talk to Lomanitz,
I'll talk to the others.

643
00:37:40,766 --> 00:37:43,935
You don't have to worry.
It's done, Lawrence.

644
00:37:48,807 --> 00:37:50,841
Then welcome to the war.

645
00:37:50,842 --> 00:37:53,144
I filled out
my first security questionnaire

646
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:56,380
and was informed that my
involvement with left-wing groups

647
00:37:56,381 --> 00:38:00,384
would not prove a bar to my
working on the atomic program.

648
00:38:00,385 --> 00:38:03,120
Why were
his communist associations

649
00:38:03,121 --> 00:38:06,057
not seen as a security risk
during the war?

650
00:38:06,058 --> 00:38:09,193
Senator, I can't possibly
answer for security clearance

651
00:38:09,194 --> 00:38:11,462
granted years
before I ever met the man.

652
00:38:11,463 --> 00:38:13,431
Fine. What about after?

653
00:38:13,432 --> 00:38:15,232
After the war,

654
00:38:15,233 --> 00:38:19,136
Dr. Oppenheimer was the most
respected scientific voice in the world.

655
00:38:19,137 --> 00:38:21,238
That's why I asked him
to run the Institute.

656
00:38:21,239 --> 00:38:24,408
That's why he advised
the Atomic Energy Commission.

657
00:38:24,409 --> 00:38:25,576
Simple as that.

658
00:38:25,577 --> 00:38:28,112
What are they accusing me of?

659
00:38:28,113 --> 00:38:31,582
I think they just wanna know what
happened between 1947 and 1954

660
00:38:31,583 --> 00:38:34,618
to change your mind on
Oppenheimer's security clearance.

661
00:38:34,619 --> 00:38:35,686
I didn't.

662
00:38:35,687 --> 00:38:37,355
I was chair of the AEC,

663
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:40,658
but it wasn't me that brought
the charges against Robert.

664
00:38:40,659 --> 00:38:42,293
Who did?

665
00:38:42,294 --> 00:38:44,128
Some former staff member of the
Joint Congressional Committee.

666
00:38:44,129 --> 00:38:47,264
He was a rabid anti-communist
named Borden.

667
00:38:47,265 --> 00:38:49,700
He wrote to the FBI
demanding they take action.

668
00:38:49,701 --> 00:38:52,169
The FBI? Why not go
to the AEC direct?

669
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:54,839
Why get caught
holding the knife yourself?

670
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,741
What did Borden have
against Oppenheimer?

671
00:38:56,742 --> 00:38:59,210
This was the McCarthy Era.

672
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:02,513
People hounded out of jobs
for any hint of red.

673
00:39:02,514 --> 00:39:05,583
And then, reading
Oppenheimer's security file,

674
00:39:05,584 --> 00:39:08,853
his communist brother,
sister-in-law, fiancée,

675
00:39:08,854 --> 00:39:10,388
best friend, wife.

676
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:12,590
That's before we even get
to the Chevalier incident.

677
00:39:12,591 --> 00:39:16,127
But how would Borden have access
to Oppenheimer's security file?

678
00:39:16,128 --> 00:39:18,330
Because somebody gave it to him.

679
00:39:19,097 --> 00:39:21,766
Somebody
who wanted Robert silenced.

680
00:39:21,767 --> 00:39:23,634
Who?
Who knows?

681
00:39:23,635 --> 00:39:28,339
Robert didn't take care not to upset
the power brokers in Washington.

682
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:31,208
His opinions on the atom
became definitive

683
00:39:31,209 --> 00:39:34,079
and he wasn't always patient
with us mere mortals.

684
00:39:37,682 --> 00:39:39,850
I came in for plenty
of harsh treatment.

685
00:39:39,851 --> 00:39:43,220
There was an AEC vote

686
00:39:43,221 --> 00:39:45,656
on the export of isotopes
to Norway,

687
00:39:45,657 --> 00:39:48,626
and they drafted in Robert
to make me look like a fool.

688
00:39:48,627 --> 00:39:49,960
But, Dr. Oppenheimer,

689
00:39:49,961 --> 00:39:51,429
we've already heard
from Admiral Strauss

690
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:54,899
that these isotopes
could be useful to our enemies

691
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,567
in the production
of atomic weapons.

692
00:39:56,568 --> 00:39:59,503
Congressmen, you could use a
shovel in making atomic weapons.

693
00:39:59,504 --> 00:40:01,038
In fact, you do.

694
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:03,874
You could use a bottle of beer
in making atomic weapons.

695
00:40:03,875 --> 00:40:05,443
In fact, you do.

696
00:40:05,444 --> 00:40:08,646
I say isotopes are less useful
than electronic components,

697
00:40:08,647 --> 00:40:12,184
but more useful than a sandwich.

698
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:16,288
Genius is no guarantee
of wisdom.

699
00:40:17,155 --> 00:40:20,025
How could this man
who saw so much be so blind?

700
00:40:29,634 --> 00:40:30,869
Kitty?

701
00:40:35,774 --> 00:40:37,008
Kitty?

702
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:40,879
Kitty, the project...

703
00:40:41,913 --> 00:40:44,715
I'm in. I'm in.

704
00:40:44,716 --> 00:40:46,218
Let's celebrate.

705
00:40:52,057 --> 00:40:53,825
Shouldn't you go to him?

706
00:40:58,263 --> 00:41:01,833
I have been going to him
all fucking day.

707
00:41:15,146 --> 00:41:16,448
Okay.

708
00:41:23,755 --> 00:41:25,422
Here.

709
00:41:25,423 --> 00:41:26,558
Come here, darling.

710
00:41:27,225 --> 00:41:29,660
I don't know how to say this.

711
00:41:29,661 --> 00:41:32,062
I-I'm ashamed to ask.

712
00:41:32,063 --> 00:41:33,331
Anything.

713
00:41:34,065 --> 00:41:36,033
- Take Peter.
- Sure.

714
00:41:36,034 --> 00:41:38,169
No, for a while, Hoke.

715
00:41:38,904 --> 00:41:40,138
A while.

716
00:41:41,873 --> 00:41:44,074
Does Kitty know you're here?

717
00:41:44,075 --> 00:41:46,110
Yes, of course she knows.

718
00:41:46,111 --> 00:41:48,345
Of course she knows.

719
00:41:48,346 --> 00:41:51,283
We're awful people.
Selfish, awful people.

720
00:41:53,485 --> 00:41:54,518
Forget I asked.

721
00:41:54,519 --> 00:41:56,320
Selfish, awful people,

722
00:41:56,321 --> 00:41:59,057
they don't know
they're selfish and awful.

723
00:41:59,758 --> 00:42:01,293
Sit, sit, sit.

724
00:42:02,427 --> 00:42:06,598
Robert, you see
beyond the world we live in.

725
00:42:08,166 --> 00:42:10,834
There is a price to be paid
for that.

726
00:42:10,835 --> 00:42:12,437
Of course we'll help you.

727
00:42:23,348 --> 00:42:25,616
Everything's changing, Robert.

728
00:42:25,617 --> 00:42:27,384
Having a child
was always going to change...

729
00:42:27,385 --> 00:42:31,289
No, the world, it's pivoting
in some new direction.

730
00:42:32,057 --> 00:42:33,591
It's reforming.

731
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:37,595
This is your moment.

732
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:40,230
We're putting together a group
to study feasibili...

733
00:42:40,231 --> 00:42:43,301
"We" shouldn't be doing
anything. You should.

734
00:42:43,969 --> 00:42:46,103
Lawrence won't get this done.

735
00:42:46,104 --> 00:42:48,606
Or Tolman, or Rabi.
You will.

736
00:42:57,549 --> 00:42:59,484
Who are the uniforms?

737
00:43:00,118 --> 00:43:01,886
I thought you might know.

738
00:43:03,021 --> 00:43:05,056
Dr. Oppenheimer.

739
00:43:06,224 --> 00:43:07,424
I'm Colonel Groves.

740
00:43:07,425 --> 00:43:09,793
This is
Lieutenant Colonel Nichols.

741
00:43:09,794 --> 00:43:11,262
Have that dry cleaned.

742
00:43:16,401 --> 00:43:19,136
Well, if that's how you
treat Lieutenant Colonel,

743
00:43:19,137 --> 00:43:22,640
I'd hate to see how you treat
a humble physicist.

744
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:24,742
If I ever meet one,
I'll let you know.

745
00:43:24,743 --> 00:43:26,143
Ouch.

746
00:43:26,144 --> 00:43:27,945
Theaters of combat
all over the world,

747
00:43:27,946 --> 00:43:30,280
but I have to stay
in Washington.

748
00:43:30,281 --> 00:43:32,316
- Why?
- I built the Pentagon.

749
00:43:32,317 --> 00:43:37,322
The brass likes it so much they made me
take over the Manhattan Engineer District.

750
00:43:37,756 --> 00:43:38,723
Which is?

751
00:43:38,724 --> 00:43:40,758
Don't be a smart ass.

752
00:43:40,759 --> 00:43:42,426
You know damn well what it is.

753
00:43:42,427 --> 00:43:44,695
You and half of every physics
department across the country.

754
00:43:44,696 --> 00:43:46,463
That's problem number one.

755
00:43:46,464 --> 00:43:49,533
I thought problem number one
would be securing enough uranium ore.

756
00:43:49,534 --> 00:43:53,237
- 1,200 tons bought the day I took charge.
- Processing?

757
00:43:53,238 --> 00:43:55,673
Just broke ground
at Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

758
00:43:56,675 --> 00:43:58,610
Now I'm looking for
a project director.

759
00:43:59,577 --> 00:44:00,744
And my name came up?

760
00:44:00,745 --> 00:44:02,613
Nope.

761
00:44:02,614 --> 00:44:05,182
Even though you brought
quantum physics to America.

762
00:44:05,183 --> 00:44:08,453
- Which made me curious.
- What've you found out?

763
00:44:09,387 --> 00:44:11,722
You're a dilettante,
a womanizer,

764
00:44:11,723 --> 00:44:13,223
a suspected communist...

765
00:44:13,224 --> 00:44:14,725
I'm a New Deal Democrat.

766
00:44:14,726 --> 00:44:16,326
I said "suspected."

767
00:44:16,327 --> 00:44:20,431
Unstable, theatrical,
egotistical, neurotic...

768
00:44:20,432 --> 00:44:23,367
Nothing good, no? Not even,
"He's brilliant, but..."

769
00:44:23,368 --> 00:44:26,737
Well, brilliance is taken for
granted in your circle, so no.

770
00:44:26,738 --> 00:44:30,541
No, the only person who had anything
good to say was Richard Tolman.

771
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:32,609
Tolman thinks
you have integrity,

772
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:37,315
but he also strikes me as a guy who
knows more about science than people.

773
00:44:37,816 --> 00:44:39,450
Yet here you are.

774
00:44:39,451 --> 00:44:41,151
You don't take much on trust.

775
00:44:41,152 --> 00:44:43,154
I don't take anything on trust.

776
00:44:46,925 --> 00:44:48,592
Why don't you have
a Nobel prize?

777
00:44:48,593 --> 00:44:50,961
- Why aren't you a general?
- They're making me one for this.

778
00:44:50,962 --> 00:44:52,162
Perhaps I'll have the same luck.

779
00:44:52,163 --> 00:44:53,997
A Nobel prize for making a bomb?

780
00:44:53,998 --> 00:44:56,167
Alfred Nobel invented dynamite.

781
00:44:58,837 --> 00:45:00,238
So how would you proceed?

782
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:06,744
You're talking about turning theory
into a practical weapons system

783
00:45:06,745 --> 00:45:08,045
faster than the Nazis.

784
00:45:08,046 --> 00:45:09,513
Who have a 12-month head start.

785
00:45:09,514 --> 00:45:11,648
- Eighteen.
- How could you possibly know that?

786
00:45:11,649 --> 00:45:14,284
Our fast neutron research
took six months.

787
00:45:14,285 --> 00:45:15,886
The man they've undoubtedly
put in charge

788
00:45:15,887 --> 00:45:17,521
will have made that leap instantly.

789
00:45:17,522 --> 00:45:19,723
- Who do you think they put in charge?
- Werner Heisenberg.

790
00:45:19,724 --> 00:45:23,026
He has the most intuitive
understanding of atomic structure

791
00:45:23,027 --> 00:45:24,161
I have ever seen.

792
00:45:24,162 --> 00:45:25,763
- You know his work?
- I know him.

793
00:45:25,764 --> 00:45:28,365
Just like I know Walther Bothe,
Von Weizsäcker, Diebner.

794
00:45:28,366 --> 00:45:30,234
In a straight race,
the Germans win.

795
00:45:30,235 --> 00:45:31,568
We've got one hope.

796
00:45:31,569 --> 00:45:32,804
Which is?

797
00:45:33,805 --> 00:45:35,306
Anti-Semitism.

798
00:45:36,641 --> 00:45:37,475
What?

799
00:45:37,476 --> 00:45:39,343
Hitler called quantum physics

800
00:45:39,344 --> 00:45:40,577
"Jewish science."

801
00:45:40,578 --> 00:45:42,279
Said it right
to Einstein's face.

802
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:45,582
Our one hope is that Hitler
is so, so blinded by hate

803
00:45:45,583 --> 00:45:47,384
that he's denied Heisenberg
proper resources,

804
00:45:47,385 --> 00:45:49,319
because it'll take
vast resources.

805
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:51,021
Our nation's best scientists,
working together.

806
00:45:51,022 --> 00:45:52,222
Right now, they're scattered.

807
00:45:52,223 --> 00:45:53,924
Which gives us compartmentalization.

808
00:45:53,925 --> 00:45:57,127
All minds have to see the
whole task to contribute efficiently.

809
00:45:57,128 --> 00:45:59,329
Poor security
may cost us the race.

810
00:45:59,330 --> 00:46:01,398
Inefficiency will.

811
00:46:01,399 --> 00:46:03,233
The Germans know
more than us anyway.

812
00:46:03,234 --> 00:46:05,069
The Russians don't.

813
00:46:06,304 --> 00:46:09,173
Remind me,
who are we at war with?

814
00:46:09,174 --> 00:46:12,643
Somebody with your past
doesn't wanna be seen downplaying

815
00:46:12,644 --> 00:46:16,414
the importance of security
from our communist allies.

816
00:46:17,115 --> 00:46:19,483
Point taken. But, no.

817
00:46:19,484 --> 00:46:21,084
You don't get to say "no" to me.

818
00:46:21,085 --> 00:46:23,420
It's my job to say "no" to you
when you're wrong.

819
00:46:23,421 --> 00:46:25,455
So you have the job now?

820
00:46:25,456 --> 00:46:27,725
Uh, I'm considering it.

821
00:46:30,328 --> 00:46:33,164
I'm starting to see
where you got your reputation.

822
00:46:34,098 --> 00:46:36,300
My favorite response?

823
00:46:36,301 --> 00:46:38,836
"Oppenheimer couldn't run
a hamburger stand."

824
00:46:39,337 --> 00:46:41,739
I couldn't.

825
00:46:43,608 --> 00:46:45,777
But I can run
the Manhattan Project.

826
00:46:46,578 --> 00:46:48,879
There's a way to balance
these things.

827
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:53,150
Keep the Rad Lab here at
Berkeley under Lawrence.

828
00:46:53,151 --> 00:46:55,285
Met Lab in Chicago
under Szilard.

829
00:46:55,286 --> 00:46:57,855
Large scale refining,
where did you say? Tennessee.

830
00:46:57,856 --> 00:46:59,456
And Hanford.
And Hanford.

831
00:46:59,457 --> 00:47:02,993
All America's industrial might
and scientific innovation,

832
00:47:02,994 --> 00:47:05,128
connected by rail.

833
00:47:05,129 --> 00:47:06,663
Focused on one goal.

834
00:47:06,664 --> 00:47:09,433
One point in space and time.
And it comes together here.

835
00:47:09,434 --> 00:47:11,001
A secret laboratory.

836
00:47:11,002 --> 00:47:13,237
In the middle of nowhere,
secure, self-sufficient,

837
00:47:13,238 --> 00:47:14,771
equipment, housing, the works.

838
00:47:14,772 --> 00:47:17,040
Keep everyone there
until it's done.

839
00:47:17,041 --> 00:47:19,643
- I'll need the schools, stores, a church.
- Why?

840
00:47:19,644 --> 00:47:23,213
If we don't let scientists bring their
families, we'll never get the best.

841
00:47:23,214 --> 00:47:26,083
You want security,
build a town, build it fast.

842
00:47:26,084 --> 00:47:27,652
Where?

843
00:47:31,256 --> 00:47:32,956
Welcome to Los Alamos.

844
00:47:32,957 --> 00:47:35,492
Now, there's a boys' school
we'll have to commandeer

845
00:47:35,493 --> 00:47:37,494
and the local Indians
come up here for burial rites.

846
00:47:37,495 --> 00:47:39,229
But, apart from that, nothing.

847
00:47:39,230 --> 00:47:40,631
Forty miles. Any direction.

848
00:47:40,632 --> 00:47:42,799
Enough to find the perfect spot.

849
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:45,169
- What for?
- Success.

850
00:47:50,475 --> 00:47:52,510
Build him a town. Fast.

851
00:47:54,379 --> 00:47:56,246
Let's go recruit
some scientists.

852
00:47:56,247 --> 00:47:58,148
Why would I leave my family?

853
00:47:58,149 --> 00:48:00,017
I told you,
you can bring your family.

854
00:48:00,018 --> 00:48:01,385
I'm not a soldier, Oppie.

855
00:48:01,386 --> 00:48:03,553
A soldier?
He's a general.

856
00:48:03,554 --> 00:48:05,355
I've got all the soldier I need.

857
00:48:05,356 --> 00:48:07,391
What can I tell them?

858
00:48:07,392 --> 00:48:09,393
Heisenberg, Diebner,
Bothe, Bohr.

859
00:48:09,394 --> 00:48:10,761
What do these men
have in common?

860
00:48:10,762 --> 00:48:12,796
The greatest minds
on atomic theory.

861
00:48:12,797 --> 00:48:14,264
Yes, and?
Uh...

862
00:48:14,265 --> 00:48:16,334
As much as you like,

863
00:48:17,435 --> 00:48:19,803
until you feel my boot
on your balls.

864
00:48:19,804 --> 00:48:21,438
You know isotopes

865
00:48:21,439 --> 00:48:23,774
and you know explosives,
better than anyone in the world.

866
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:25,710
But you can't tell us
what you're doing.

867
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:31,682
I don't know.
The Nazis have them.

868
00:48:31,683 --> 00:48:33,850
Niels Bohr's in Copenhagen.
Under Nazi occupation.

869
00:48:33,851 --> 00:48:35,786
Did they stop printing
newspapers in Princeton?

870
00:48:35,787 --> 00:48:39,656
Why would we go to the middle of
nowhere for who knows how long?

871
00:48:39,657 --> 00:48:41,726
A year or two.
Or three.

872
00:48:42,794 --> 00:48:45,997
General, could you
give us a moment?

873
00:48:47,365 --> 00:48:50,301
It's about unleashing
the strong force

874
00:48:51,502 --> 00:48:53,304
before the Nazis do.

875
00:48:53,938 --> 00:48:55,105
Oh, my God.

876
00:48:55,106 --> 00:48:57,374
Niels won't work for
the Nazis. No, never.

877
00:48:57,375 --> 00:48:59,643
But while they have him,
we don't.

878
00:48:59,644 --> 00:49:00,844
That's why I need you.

879
00:49:00,845 --> 00:49:03,046
Why would you think I'd do that?

880
00:49:03,047 --> 00:49:04,848
Why? Why?

881
00:49:04,849 --> 00:49:07,017
How about because this is
the most important fucking thing

882
00:49:07,018 --> 00:49:09,319
to ever happen in the
history of the world.

883
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:11,956
How about that?
Fuck.

884
00:49:16,961 --> 00:49:19,863
They are not gonna let me
onto this project.

885
00:49:19,864 --> 00:49:22,566
And failing a security check is
not gonna be good for a career,

886
00:49:22,567 --> 00:49:23,734
even after the war.

887
00:49:23,735 --> 00:49:25,569
So you're a fellow traveler.

888
00:49:25,570 --> 00:49:28,005
So what?
This is a national emergency.

889
00:49:28,006 --> 00:49:31,308
I've got some skeletons,
they put me in charge.

890
00:49:31,309 --> 00:49:32,376
They need us.

891
00:49:32,377 --> 00:49:34,579
Until they don't.

892
00:49:37,882 --> 00:49:40,250
Is there any chance
of getting Bohr out of Denmark?

893
00:49:40,251 --> 00:49:41,418
Nah, no dice.

894
00:49:41,419 --> 00:49:43,620
I checked with the British.

895
00:49:43,621 --> 00:49:45,655
Until we get Allied boots
back onto the continent,

896
00:49:45,656 --> 00:49:46,924
there's just no way.

897
00:49:48,426 --> 00:49:50,027
Is he that important?

898
00:49:50,028 --> 00:49:53,030
How many people do you know
who've proved Einstein wrong?

899
00:49:54,065 --> 00:49:56,400
You know, it really would
be quicker to take a plane.

900
00:49:56,401 --> 00:49:57,968
No, plane's too risky.

901
00:49:57,969 --> 00:50:00,104
Country needs us.

902
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:06,544
The Harvard guys, they say the
building's too small for the cyclotron.

903
00:50:08,746 --> 00:50:10,748
Get them together
with the architects.

904
00:50:13,851 --> 00:50:15,987
When's this place
supposed to open?

905
00:50:18,856 --> 00:50:19,924
Two months.

906
00:50:20,925 --> 00:50:24,595
Robert, you're the great
improviser, but this...

907
00:50:25,430 --> 00:50:26,898
you can't do in your head.

908
00:50:28,299 --> 00:50:29,600
Four divisions.

909
00:50:30,535 --> 00:50:34,237
Experimental, Theoretical,
Metallurgical, Ordnance.

910
00:50:34,238 --> 00:50:35,372
Who's running Theoretical?

911
00:50:35,373 --> 00:50:37,007
I am.

912
00:50:37,008 --> 00:50:39,744
That's what I was afraid of.
You're spread too thin.

913
00:50:41,012 --> 00:50:42,613
So you take Theoretical.

914
00:50:45,316 --> 00:50:48,019
I'm not coming here, Robert.

915
00:50:54,125 --> 00:50:55,760
Why not?

916
00:51:01,799 --> 00:51:05,703
You drop a bomb, and it
falls on the just and the unjust.

917
00:51:06,838 --> 00:51:09,539
I don't wish the culmination
of three centuries of physics

918
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:11,742
to be a weapon
of mass destruction.

919
00:51:21,385 --> 00:51:23,186
Izzy.

920
00:51:23,187 --> 00:51:27,859
I don't know if we can be
trusted with such a weapon.

921
00:51:29,293 --> 00:51:32,497
But I know the Nazis can't.

922
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:37,768
We have no choice.

923
00:51:40,438 --> 00:51:41,672
Then...

924
00:51:43,074 --> 00:51:45,909
the second thing you'll have
to do is appoint Hans Bethe

925
00:51:45,910 --> 00:51:47,879
to run the theoretical division.

926
00:51:49,881 --> 00:51:51,848
Wait, what was the first?

927
00:51:51,849 --> 00:51:55,519
Take off that ridiculous
uniform. You're a scientist.

928
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,587
Groves is insisting we join.

929
00:51:57,588 --> 00:51:59,656
Tell Groves
to go shit in his hat.

930
00:51:59,657 --> 00:52:01,758
They need us for who we are.

931
00:52:01,759 --> 00:52:05,429
So be yourself.
Only better.

932
00:52:44,669 --> 00:52:46,203
This is the only key.

933
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:49,539
And Teller's already here.
Shall I just show him in?

934
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:52,843
No, let's wait for the others.

935
00:52:59,317 --> 00:53:00,551
Let's get started.

936
00:53:01,152 --> 00:53:02,452
Hello, Edward.

937
00:53:02,453 --> 00:53:03,587
Yes.

938
00:53:03,588 --> 00:53:05,889
Gentlemen, so, we will work here

939
00:53:05,890 --> 00:53:08,792
until the T-section
at Los Alamos is finished.

940
00:53:08,793 --> 00:53:09,859
Edward, can I please...

941
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:11,495
It is more important.

942
00:53:13,164 --> 00:53:15,131
When I calculated
the chain reaction,

943
00:53:15,132 --> 00:53:17,969
I found a rather
troubling possibility.

944
00:53:18,502 --> 00:53:21,705
No. This can't be right.

945
00:53:21,706 --> 00:53:23,440
Show me how you did
your calculations.

946
00:53:23,441 --> 00:53:24,709
Yes.

947
00:53:28,179 --> 00:53:31,782
It's exponential.
No. No, no, no. No.

948
00:53:35,086 --> 00:53:36,353
This is fantasy.

949
00:53:36,354 --> 00:53:38,655
Teller's calculations
can't be right.

950
00:53:38,656 --> 00:53:41,524
Do them yourself
while I go to Princeton.

951
00:53:41,525 --> 00:53:43,393
What for?
To talk to Einstein.

952
00:53:43,394 --> 00:53:45,895
There's not much common
ground between you two.

953
00:53:45,896 --> 00:53:47,865
That's why I should
get his view.

954
00:53:52,503 --> 00:53:54,504
- Albert.
- Mmm?

955
00:53:54,505 --> 00:53:57,240
Ah, Dr. Oppenheimer.

956
00:53:57,241 --> 00:54:00,577
Well, have you met Dr. Gödel?
We walk here most days.

957
00:54:00,578 --> 00:54:04,981
Trees are the most
inspiring structures.

958
00:54:04,982 --> 00:54:06,951
Albert, might I have a word?

959
00:54:07,618 --> 00:54:09,787
Of course. Excuse me, Kurt.

960
00:54:11,222 --> 00:54:14,324
You know, some days,
Kurt refuses to eat.

961
00:54:14,325 --> 00:54:15,892
Even in Princeton.

962
00:54:15,893 --> 00:54:19,030
He's convinced that the
Nazis can poison his food.

963
00:54:20,298 --> 00:54:21,666
Hmm?

964
00:54:24,669 --> 00:54:25,936
Wha...

965
00:54:30,408 --> 00:54:33,209
Whose... Whose work is this?

966
00:54:33,210 --> 00:54:34,612
Teller's.

967
00:54:35,446 --> 00:54:37,248
What do you take it to mean?

968
00:54:37,848 --> 00:54:39,649
Neutrons smash into nucleus,

969
00:54:39,650 --> 00:54:43,187
releasing neutrons
to smash into other nuclei.

970
00:54:43,888 --> 00:54:45,855
Criticality,
a point of no return,

971
00:54:45,856 --> 00:54:47,490
massive explosive force.

972
00:54:47,491 --> 00:54:50,094
But this time, the chain
reaction doesn't stop.

973
00:54:51,028 --> 00:54:53,998
It would ignite the atmosphere.

974
00:54:55,066 --> 00:54:56,933
When we detonate
an atomic device,

975
00:54:56,934 --> 00:54:59,270
we might start
a chain reaction that...

976
00:55:00,571 --> 00:55:02,073
destroys the world.

977
00:55:02,873 --> 00:55:04,641
So here we are, hmm?

978
00:55:04,642 --> 00:55:08,978
Lost in your quantum world
of probabilities

979
00:55:08,979 --> 00:55:10,880
and needing certainty.

980
00:55:10,881 --> 00:55:13,516
Can you run
the calculations yourself?

981
00:55:13,517 --> 00:55:18,488
About the only thing you and I have in
common is a disdain for mathematics.

982
00:55:18,489 --> 00:55:21,891
Who's working on this
in Berkeley? Hans Bethe.

983
00:55:21,892 --> 00:55:24,361
Well, he'll get to the truth.

984
00:55:25,997 --> 00:55:28,299
And if the truth
is catastrophic?

985
00:55:28,866 --> 00:55:30,166
Then you stop.

986
00:55:30,167 --> 00:55:33,204
And you share your findings
with the Nazis.

987
00:55:33,938 --> 00:55:37,074
So neither side
destroys the world.

988
00:55:40,344 --> 00:55:41,378
Robert.

989
00:55:42,747 --> 00:55:45,983
This is yours, not mine.

990
00:55:58,863 --> 00:56:00,196
Teller's wrong.

991
00:56:00,197 --> 00:56:02,333
He's wrong.
Shh, shh, shh...

992
00:56:11,242 --> 00:56:13,843
When you know Teller's
critical assumptions,

993
00:56:13,844 --> 00:56:15,345
the real picture emerges.

994
00:56:15,346 --> 00:56:17,080
Bottom line?

995
00:56:17,081 --> 00:56:20,350
The chances of an uncontrolled
nuclear reaction are near zero.

996
00:56:20,351 --> 00:56:21,852
Near zero.

997
00:56:22,987 --> 00:56:24,554
Oppie, this is good news.

998
00:56:24,555 --> 00:56:26,523
Mmm.

999
00:56:26,524 --> 00:56:29,492
Can you run them again?
No, you'll get the same answer.

1000
00:56:29,493 --> 00:56:31,227
Till they actually detonate
one of these things,

1001
00:56:31,228 --> 00:56:33,863
the best assurance
you're going to get is this.

1002
00:56:33,864 --> 00:56:35,299
Near zero.

1003
00:56:37,368 --> 00:56:41,004
Theory will
take you only so far. Mmm.

1004
00:56:41,005 --> 00:56:44,140
- Hello!
- Hello, you. We missed him.

1005
00:56:44,141 --> 00:56:46,609
You want to adopt?
She's kidding.

1006
00:56:46,610 --> 00:56:48,379
We wanted to see you
before we left.

1007
00:56:48,946 --> 00:56:51,348
For parts unknown.

1008
00:56:52,550 --> 00:56:56,386
You know who I ran into
the other day? Eltenton.

1009
00:56:56,387 --> 00:56:57,654
Huh.

1010
00:56:57,655 --> 00:56:59,989
The chemist from Shell?
The union guy?

1011
00:56:59,990 --> 00:57:03,293
Yeah. The FAECT guy.

1012
00:57:03,294 --> 00:57:06,964
He was moaning about
how we're handling the war.

1013
00:57:07,465 --> 00:57:08,832
How so?

1014
00:57:08,833 --> 00:57:11,601
Lack of cooperation
with our allies.

1015
00:57:11,602 --> 00:57:15,772
Apparently our government's not
sharing any research with the Russians.

1016
00:57:15,773 --> 00:57:20,077
Well, he said, "Most scientists
think the policy is stupid."

1017
00:57:23,481 --> 00:57:25,181
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

1018
00:57:25,182 --> 00:57:30,221
He mentioned that if anyone had
anything they wanted to pass on,

1019
00:57:30,354 --> 00:57:34,391
going around official
channels, that he could help.

1020
00:57:42,933 --> 00:57:44,935
That would be treason.

1021
00:57:45,469 --> 00:57:46,937
Yes, of course.

1022
00:57:47,605 --> 00:57:49,340
I just thought you should know.

1023
00:57:51,809 --> 00:57:55,346
The brat is down.
Where are the martinis?

1024
00:58:00,618 --> 00:58:02,051
Coming right up.

1025
00:58:02,052 --> 00:58:03,820
The conversation ended there.

1026
00:58:03,821 --> 00:58:06,956
Nothing in our long-standing
friendship would have led me to believe

1027
00:58:06,957 --> 00:58:09,792
that Chevalier was
actually seeking information,

1028
00:58:09,793 --> 00:58:14,832
and I am certain that he had no idea
of the work in which I was engaged.

1029
00:58:19,270 --> 00:58:21,004
It has long been clear to me

1030
00:58:21,005 --> 00:58:23,940
that I should have reported
this incident at once.

1031
00:58:23,941 --> 00:58:26,976
The Oppenheimer situation
highlights the tension

1032
00:58:26,977 --> 00:58:30,246
between scientists
and the security apparatus.

1033
00:58:30,247 --> 00:58:32,815
In hopes of learning how the
nominee handled such issues

1034
00:58:32,816 --> 00:58:34,684
during his time at the AEC,

1035
00:58:34,685 --> 00:58:37,755
we'll have a scientist
appearing before the committee.

1036
00:58:38,689 --> 00:58:41,491
Who are they bringing in?
They haven't said.

1037
00:58:41,492 --> 00:58:42,592
Mr. Chairman, if I may,

1038
00:58:42,593 --> 00:58:45,261
I'm nominated
for commerce secretary.

1039
00:58:45,262 --> 00:58:47,697
Why seek the opinion
of scientists?

1040
00:58:47,698 --> 00:58:49,933
This is a cabinet post, Admiral.

1041
00:58:49,934 --> 00:58:52,569
We seek a wide range of opinion.

1042
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:55,038
Well, I'd like to know the name
of the scientist testifying,

1043
00:58:55,039 --> 00:58:56,640
I'd like the chance
to cross-examine.

1044
00:58:57,107 --> 00:58:59,043
This is not a court.

1045
00:58:59,677 --> 00:59:01,477
Formality, huh?

1046
00:59:01,478 --> 00:59:04,981
No presidential Cabinet nominee
has failed to be confirmed since 1925.

1047
00:59:04,982 --> 00:59:07,183
This is just how
the game is played.

1048
00:59:07,184 --> 00:59:09,552
It's in the bag, Lewis.
So play nice.

1049
00:59:09,553 --> 00:59:11,788
They bring in a scientist,
so what?

1050
00:59:11,789 --> 00:59:13,957
You don't know scientists
like I do, Counselor.

1051
00:59:13,958 --> 00:59:16,159
They resent anyone
who questions their judgment,

1052
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:18,194
especially if you're not
one of them.

1053
00:59:18,195 --> 00:59:19,629
I was chair of the AEC.

1054
00:59:19,630 --> 00:59:21,764
I'm easy to blame
for what happened to Robert.

1055
00:59:21,765 --> 00:59:24,233
We can't have the Senate
thinking the scientific community

1056
00:59:24,234 --> 00:59:26,070
doesn't support you, sir.

1057
00:59:26,937 --> 00:59:28,938
- Or should we pivot?
- To what?

1058
00:59:28,939 --> 00:59:30,373
And embrace it.

1059
00:59:30,374 --> 00:59:33,142
"I fought Oppenheimer
and the US won."

1060
00:59:33,143 --> 00:59:34,877
I-I don't think
we need to go there.

1061
00:59:34,878 --> 00:59:37,013
Isn't there someone we can call
who knows what really happened?

1062
00:59:37,014 --> 00:59:38,815
- Teller.
- He'll make an impression.

1063
00:59:38,816 --> 00:59:41,451
- Can you get the name of the scientist they've called?
- Probably.

1064
00:59:41,452 --> 00:59:44,554
Find out if he was based in
Chicago or Los Alamos during the war.

1065
00:59:44,555 --> 00:59:47,090
- Why does that matter?
- If he was based in Chicago,

1066
00:59:47,091 --> 00:59:48,825
he worked under Szilard
and Fermi,

1067
00:59:48,826 --> 00:59:50,927
not the cult of Oppie
at Los Alamos.

1068
00:59:50,928 --> 00:59:52,395
Robert built that damn place.

1069
00:59:52,396 --> 00:59:56,633
He was founder, mayor, sheriff,
all rolled into one.

1070
01:00:08,946 --> 01:00:10,914
All it needs is a saloon.

1071
01:00:38,308 --> 01:00:39,977
Let's go and see.

1072
01:00:40,711 --> 01:00:42,446
There's no kitchen.

1073
01:00:43,047 --> 01:00:45,616
Really? We'll fix that.

1074
01:00:52,256 --> 01:00:56,759
Barbed wire? Guns? Oppie.

1075
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:58,495
We're at war, Hans.

1076
01:01:00,864 --> 01:01:03,433
Halifax, 1917.

1077
01:01:03,434 --> 01:01:06,370
A cargo ship carrying munitions
explodes in the harbor.

1078
01:01:08,672 --> 01:01:11,742
A vast and sudden
chemical reaction.

1079
01:01:15,346 --> 01:01:17,947
The biggest man-made
explosion in history.

1080
01:01:17,948 --> 01:01:21,484
Now let's calculate how much
more destructive it would have been

1081
01:01:21,485 --> 01:01:25,221
if it were a nuclear,
and not a chemical, reaction.

1082
01:01:25,222 --> 01:01:28,257
Expressing power
in terms of tons of TNT.

1083
01:01:28,258 --> 01:01:29,859
But it will be thousands.

1084
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:33,197
Well, then... kilotons.

1085
01:01:36,667 --> 01:01:41,505
Using U-235, the
bomb will need... Ah...

1086
01:01:42,206 --> 01:01:43,673
Right, sorry.

1087
01:01:43,674 --> 01:01:47,343
Gadget will need a 33-pound
sphere about this size.

1088
01:01:47,344 --> 01:01:51,115
Or using plutonium,
the ten-pound sphere.

1089
01:01:52,349 --> 01:01:56,787
Here's the amount of uranium
Oak Ridge refined all of last month.

1090
01:02:00,591 --> 01:02:03,560
And the Hanford plant
made this much plutonium.

1091
01:02:05,596 --> 01:02:09,600
Now, if we can enrich these amounts,
we need a way to detonate them.

1092
01:02:10,801 --> 01:02:12,369
Are we boring you, Edward?

1093
01:02:13,003 --> 01:02:14,537
A little bit, yes.

1094
01:02:14,538 --> 01:02:16,005
May I ask why?

1095
01:02:16,006 --> 01:02:18,975
We all entered this room knowing
a fission bomb was possible.

1096
01:02:18,976 --> 01:02:22,745
- How about we leave it with something new?
- Such as?

1097
01:02:22,746 --> 01:02:26,784
Instead of uranium or plutonium,
we use hydrogen.

1098
01:02:27,951 --> 01:02:29,586
Heavy hydrogen.

1099
01:02:30,020 --> 01:02:31,587
Deuterium.

1100
01:02:31,588 --> 01:02:32,822
You see?

1101
01:02:32,823 --> 01:02:35,358
We compact the atoms together
under great pressure

1102
01:02:35,359 --> 01:02:37,561
to induce a fusion reaction.

1103
01:02:38,429 --> 01:02:41,130
Then we'll get not kilotons,

1104
01:02:41,131 --> 01:02:42,466
but megatons.

1105
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:45,001
Okay, hang on, hang on.

1106
01:02:45,002 --> 01:02:49,373
So how do you generate enough
force to fuse hydrogen atoms?

1107
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:51,808
A small fission bomb.

1108
01:02:52,409 --> 01:02:53,744
Ah...
There we are!

1109
01:02:55,445 --> 01:02:57,180
Well, since we're going
to need one anyway,

1110
01:02:57,181 --> 01:02:59,215
can we get back
to the business at hand?

1111
01:02:59,216 --> 01:03:04,153
The isotopes issue wasn't your
most important policy disagreement

1112
01:03:04,154 --> 01:03:05,488
with Dr. Oppenheimer,

1113
01:03:05,489 --> 01:03:07,990
it was the hydrogen bomb,
wasn't it?

1114
01:03:07,991 --> 01:03:13,030
As colleagues, we agreed to
disagree on a great many things, uh,

1115
01:03:13,197 --> 01:03:17,434
and, well, one of them was the
need for an H-bomb program, yes.

1116
01:03:30,581 --> 01:03:33,282
Thanks for convening
on short notice.

1117
01:03:33,283 --> 01:03:34,885
I can't believe it.

1118
01:03:36,053 --> 01:03:37,320
Here we are.

1119
01:03:37,321 --> 01:03:39,155
Catch me up.
What do we know?

1120
01:03:39,156 --> 01:03:43,492
One of our B-29s over the North
Pacific has detected radiation.

1121
01:03:43,493 --> 01:03:45,394
Do we have the filter paper?

1122
01:03:45,395 --> 01:03:48,197
- There's no doubt what this is.
- White House says there's a doubt.

1123
01:03:48,198 --> 01:03:49,665
Wishful thinking, I'm afraid.

1124
01:03:49,666 --> 01:03:52,703
Are those the long-range
detection filter papers?

1125
01:03:53,470 --> 01:03:55,138
It's an atomic test.

1126
01:03:58,442 --> 01:04:00,009
The Russians have a bomb.

1127
01:04:00,010 --> 01:04:03,379
We're supposed to be years
ahead of them, but some...

1128
01:04:03,380 --> 01:04:06,983
What were you guys doing at
Los Alamos? Wasn't security tight?

1129
01:04:06,984 --> 01:04:10,187
- Of course it was. You weren't there.
- Forgive me, Doctor...

1130
01:04:11,989 --> 01:04:13,423
but I was there.

1131
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:17,894
We can now consider the
actual mechanics of detonation.

1132
01:04:17,895 --> 01:04:19,195
Any ideas?

1133
01:04:19,196 --> 01:04:20,830
I call this "shooting."

1134
01:04:20,831 --> 01:04:24,300
We fire a chunk of fissionable
material into a larger sphere

1135
01:04:24,301 --> 01:04:27,003
with enough force
to achieve criticality.

1136
01:04:27,004 --> 01:04:28,638
What do we think? Anyone?

1137
01:04:28,639 --> 01:04:30,406
I've been thinking
about implosion.

1138
01:04:30,407 --> 01:04:33,710
Explosives around the sphere
blast inwards, crushing the material.

1139
01:04:34,545 --> 01:04:36,445
I'd like to investigate
that idea.

1140
01:04:36,446 --> 01:04:38,849
I'll talk to Ordnance,
get you blowing things up.

1141
01:04:39,816 --> 01:04:42,185
- Progress?
- Nice to see you too.

1142
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:44,620
Meet the British contingent.

1143
01:04:44,621 --> 01:04:46,422
Dr. Oppenheimer,
Klaus Fuchs.

1144
01:04:46,423 --> 01:04:48,324
How long have you been British?

1145
01:04:48,325 --> 01:04:50,526
Since Hitler told me
I wasn't German. Aha.

1146
01:04:50,527 --> 01:04:53,396
Come, welcome to Los Alamos.

1147
01:04:53,397 --> 01:04:55,264
School's up and running.

1148
01:04:55,265 --> 01:04:57,501
Bar... always running.

1149
01:04:58,368 --> 01:05:00,704
And I thought of a way
to reduce support staff.

1150
01:05:01,838 --> 01:05:03,873
- Is that...
- Mrs. Serber, yes.

1151
01:05:03,874 --> 01:05:07,343
I've offered jobs to all the wives.
Admin, librarians, computation.

1152
01:05:07,344 --> 01:05:09,512
We cut down on staff,
keep families together.

1153
01:05:09,513 --> 01:05:11,514
- Are these women qualified?
- Don't be absurd.

1154
01:05:11,515 --> 01:05:13,849
These are some of the
brightest minds in our community.

1155
01:05:13,850 --> 01:05:15,685
And they're already
security cleared.

1156
01:05:15,686 --> 01:05:17,253
I've informed General Groves
you've been holding

1157
01:05:17,254 --> 01:05:19,388
cross-divisional, open
discussions on a nightly basis.

1158
01:05:19,389 --> 01:05:20,957
Shut them down.

1159
01:05:20,958 --> 01:05:23,192
Compartmentalization is the key
to maintaining security...

1160
01:05:23,193 --> 01:05:24,527
It's only the top men.

1161
01:05:24,528 --> 01:05:26,429
Who presumably communicate
with subordinates.

1162
01:05:26,430 --> 01:05:28,531
These men aren't stupid.
They can be discreet.

1163
01:05:28,532 --> 01:05:32,436
- I don't like it.
- You don't like anything enough for that to be a fair test.

1164
01:05:38,141 --> 01:05:40,576
Once a week. Top men only.

1165
01:05:40,577 --> 01:05:43,380
- I'd like to bring my brother here.
- No.

1166
01:05:44,881 --> 01:05:47,049
Nichols.

1167
01:05:47,050 --> 01:05:49,852
I still haven't heard that my security
clearance has been approved.

1168
01:05:49,853 --> 01:05:52,054
- It hasn't.
- We're going to Chicago tomorrow.

1169
01:05:52,055 --> 01:05:53,656
Well, you should wait.

1170
01:05:53,657 --> 01:05:56,158
You are aware that the Nazis
have a two-year head start?

1171
01:05:56,159 --> 01:05:58,094
Dr. Oppenheimer, the fact
that your security clearance

1172
01:05:58,095 --> 01:06:00,396
is proving difficult to obtain
is not my fault.

1173
01:06:00,397 --> 01:06:02,264
It's yours.

1174
01:06:02,265 --> 01:06:04,967
May not be your fault, but it's
your problem. Because I'm going.

1175
01:06:04,968 --> 01:06:07,537
And how many people
were in these, uh,

1176
01:06:08,171 --> 01:06:09,839
open discussions?

1177
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:12,341
Too many. Compartmentalization
was supposed to be the protocol.

1178
01:06:12,342 --> 01:06:14,076
We were in a race
against the Nazis.

1179
01:06:14,077 --> 01:06:17,480
- And now the race is against the Soviets.
- Not unless we start it.

1180
01:06:17,481 --> 01:06:21,584
Robert, they just fired
a starting gun.

1181
01:06:21,585 --> 01:06:23,819
What's the nature of the device
they detonated?

1182
01:06:23,820 --> 01:06:27,490
The data indicates it may have
been a plutonium implosion device.

1183
01:06:27,491 --> 01:06:30,459
Like the one you built
at Los Alamos.

1184
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:33,662
The Russians have a bomb,
Truman needs to know what's next.

1185
01:06:33,663 --> 01:06:35,631
What's next? Arms talks.

1186
01:06:35,632 --> 01:06:37,467
- Arms talks.
- Obviously.

1187
01:06:38,402 --> 01:06:39,935
What about the Super?

1188
01:06:39,936 --> 01:06:43,406
Does Truman even know about it?
Did we brief him on that?

1189
01:06:43,407 --> 01:06:44,840
Not specifically.

1190
01:06:44,841 --> 01:06:46,509
We still don't know
if a hydrogen bomb's

1191
01:06:46,510 --> 01:06:47,843
technically feasible.

1192
01:06:47,844 --> 01:06:49,712
My understanding is
that Teller proposed it?

1193
01:06:49,713 --> 01:06:51,280
Yes.
At Los Alamos?

1194
01:06:51,281 --> 01:06:53,482
Teller's designs have always
been wildly impractical.

1195
01:06:53,483 --> 01:06:55,551
You'd have to deliver
by ox cart.

1196
01:06:55,552 --> 01:06:57,553
- Not airplane.
- Oppie.

1197
01:06:57,554 --> 01:07:00,023
I'm sorry, Dr. Lawrence.
Do you want to comment?

1198
01:07:01,825 --> 01:07:02,926
No.

1199
01:07:04,428 --> 01:07:06,929
Because if it can
put us ahead again,

1200
01:07:06,930 --> 01:07:11,969
the President of the United
States needs to know about it.

1201
01:07:14,004 --> 01:07:18,541
And if the Russians know about it
already from a spy at Los Alamos,

1202
01:07:18,542 --> 01:07:19,975
then we've gotta get going.

1203
01:07:19,976 --> 01:07:22,912
There's no proof
there was a spy at Los Alamos.

1204
01:07:22,913 --> 01:07:23,980
Robert.

1205
01:07:28,452 --> 01:07:30,553
They put it
under the football stadium?

1206
01:07:30,554 --> 01:07:32,521
The field's not in use anymore.

1207
01:07:32,522 --> 01:07:33,990
Just as well.

1208
01:07:36,593 --> 01:07:38,527
- Oppie.
- Dr. Fermi.

1209
01:07:38,528 --> 01:07:41,163
Come stai? Va bene?

1210
01:07:41,164 --> 01:07:43,934
I hear you got a little
town. Yes. Come and see.

1211
01:07:45,268 --> 01:07:48,939
Who could think straight
in a place like that? Huh?

1212
01:07:49,673 --> 01:07:51,640
Everybody will go crazy.

1213
01:07:51,641 --> 01:07:54,945
Thank you for
the vote of confidence, Szilard.

1214
01:07:56,012 --> 01:07:59,415
Do we really... Do we
really need that in the notes?

1215
01:07:59,416 --> 01:08:01,484
When are you going to
try it out?

1216
01:08:01,485 --> 01:08:03,119
We did.

1217
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:06,756
The first self-sustaining
nuclear chain reaction.

1218
01:08:07,357 --> 01:08:08,691
Didn't Groves tell you?

1219
01:08:08,692 --> 01:08:10,694
No.

1220
01:08:15,098 --> 01:08:18,234
One at a time, please.
One at a time.

1221
01:08:18,235 --> 01:08:20,035
Dr. Oppenheimer?

1222
01:08:20,036 --> 01:08:23,305
I tried Personnel.
They asked if I could type.

1223
01:08:23,306 --> 01:08:24,507
Can you?

1224
01:08:24,508 --> 01:08:25,674
Harvard forgot to teach that

1225
01:08:25,675 --> 01:08:27,477
on the graduate
chemistry course.

1226
01:08:29,045 --> 01:08:31,915
Condon, put Mrs. Hornig here
on the plutonium team.

1227
01:08:37,587 --> 01:08:39,455
What the hell
were you doing in Chicago?

1228
01:08:39,456 --> 01:08:40,890
Visiting the Met?

1229
01:08:40,891 --> 01:08:43,893
Why? Because we
have every right...

1230
01:08:43,894 --> 01:08:48,164
You have just the rights that
I give you. No more, no less.

1231
01:08:48,165 --> 01:08:50,299
We are adults trying
to run a project here.

1232
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:52,001
This is ridiculous.

1233
01:08:52,002 --> 01:08:53,069
Tell him.

1234
01:08:54,304 --> 01:08:57,541
Compartmentalization
is the protocol we agreed to.

1235
01:08:58,141 --> 01:08:59,742
Enough of this madhouse.

1236
01:08:59,743 --> 01:09:01,744
Nobody can work
under these conditions.

1237
01:09:01,745 --> 01:09:04,914
You know what, Generalissimo?

1238
01:09:04,915 --> 01:09:06,282
I quit.

1239
01:09:06,283 --> 01:09:07,717
Thanks for nothing.

1240
01:09:09,686 --> 01:09:11,354
Better off without him.

1241
01:09:12,455 --> 01:09:13,522
Aren't you more concerned

1242
01:09:13,523 --> 01:09:15,859
about his discretion out there?

1243
01:09:16,660 --> 01:09:18,228
We'll have him killed.

1244
01:09:19,896 --> 01:09:21,864
I was just kidding.

1245
01:09:21,865 --> 01:09:24,200
No, he hates me, not America.

1246
01:09:24,201 --> 01:09:27,403
You know, General, not everyone
has levers to pull like mine.

1247
01:09:27,404 --> 01:09:29,171
I don't think I understand.

1248
01:09:29,172 --> 01:09:31,473
You didn't hire me
despite my left-wing past,

1249
01:09:31,474 --> 01:09:33,209
you hired me because of it.

1250
01:09:34,144 --> 01:09:35,945
So you could control me.

1251
01:09:35,946 --> 01:09:38,681
Well, I'm not that subtle.

1252
01:09:38,682 --> 01:09:40,149
I'm just a humble soldier.

1253
01:09:40,150 --> 01:09:42,218
You're neither humble,
nor just a soldier.

1254
01:09:42,219 --> 01:09:45,087
- You studied engineering at MIT.
- Guilty as charged.

1255
01:09:45,088 --> 01:09:46,622
Well, now we understand
each other,

1256
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:48,157
perhaps you can get me
my security clearance

1257
01:09:48,158 --> 01:09:51,061
so I can perform
this miracle for you.

1258
01:09:56,199 --> 01:09:58,701
General Groves, were you aware of Dr.
Oppenheimer's

1259
01:09:58,702 --> 01:10:01,136
left-wing associations
when you appointed him?

1260
01:10:01,137 --> 01:10:03,272
I was aware that there
were suspicions about him.

1261
01:10:03,273 --> 01:10:06,408
I was aware he had a very
extreme, liberal background.

1262
01:10:06,409 --> 01:10:09,645
In your opinion, would he ever
consciously commit a disloyal act?

1263
01:10:09,646 --> 01:10:11,447
I would be amazed if he did.

1264
01:10:11,448 --> 01:10:14,350
So you had complete
confidence in his integrity?

1265
01:10:14,351 --> 01:10:17,086
At Los Alamos, yes, which
is where I really knew him.

1266
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:19,888
General, did your security
officers on the project

1267
01:10:19,889 --> 01:10:22,157
advise you against the
clearance of Dr. Oppenheimer?

1268
01:10:22,158 --> 01:10:25,995
They could not and would not
clear him until I insisted.

1269
01:10:25,996 --> 01:10:30,032
And it's safe to say that you had a pretty good
knowledge of Dr. Oppenheimer's security file.

1270
01:10:30,033 --> 01:10:31,500
I did.

1271
01:10:31,501 --> 01:10:34,103
There's only really one question
I need answered here today.

1272
01:10:34,104 --> 01:10:36,171
In light of
the current AEC guidelines,

1273
01:10:36,172 --> 01:10:38,841
would you clear
Dr. Oppenheimer today?

1274
01:10:38,842 --> 01:10:40,944
Do you have the guidelines?

1275
01:10:48,084 --> 01:10:50,619
Under current AEC guidelines,

1276
01:10:50,620 --> 01:10:54,591
would you clear
Dr. Oppenheimer today?

1277
01:11:05,869 --> 01:11:07,637
Physics and New Mexico, huh?

1278
01:11:08,972 --> 01:11:10,406
My God.

1279
01:11:10,407 --> 01:11:11,874
What a trek.

1280
01:11:11,875 --> 01:11:13,409
That's why you need a liaison.

1281
01:11:13,410 --> 01:11:14,978
I'm appointing Lomanitz.

1282
01:11:15,879 --> 01:11:17,212
You're gonna be okay.

1283
01:11:17,213 --> 01:11:18,682
This way, gentlemen.

1284
01:11:28,491 --> 01:11:30,392
- Dr. Lawrence.
- Leslie.

1285
01:11:30,393 --> 01:11:32,795
I'd like to remind you what
we talked about in Berkeley.

1286
01:11:32,796 --> 01:11:35,131
Compartmentalization.
I understand completely.

1287
01:11:40,670 --> 01:11:41,905
Thank you.

1288
01:11:49,980 --> 01:11:51,680
Greetings from Berkeley.

1289
01:11:51,681 --> 01:11:54,516
I am here to update you on our
progress and solicit your input.

1290
01:11:54,517 --> 01:11:57,119
To do so, I am going to
have to share a few things

1291
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:59,922
that General Groves
told me not to.

1292
01:11:59,923 --> 01:12:02,858
Sorry, General, I said I
understood, not that I agreed.

1293
01:12:02,859 --> 01:12:04,526
Okay.

1294
01:12:04,527 --> 01:12:06,428
Gentlemen, to business.

1295
01:12:06,429 --> 01:12:09,131
There were rumors of
espionage at Los Alamos.

1296
01:12:09,132 --> 01:12:10,632
Unsubstantiated.

1297
01:12:10,633 --> 01:12:13,435
I'm told that there
were communists on the project.

1298
01:12:13,436 --> 01:12:15,504
We didn't knowingly employ
any communists.

1299
01:12:15,505 --> 01:12:18,240
Were any of them involved
in discussions of the Super?

1300
01:12:18,241 --> 01:12:20,976
I seem to remember you demanding
your brother come to Los Alamos.

1301
01:12:20,977 --> 01:12:22,778
My brother had left
the Party by then.

1302
01:12:22,779 --> 01:12:24,079
What about Lomanitz?

1303
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:25,814
Lomanitz was never employed
at Los Alamos.

1304
01:12:25,815 --> 01:12:26,882
He was a liaison.

1305
01:12:26,883 --> 01:12:28,117
Our security was tight,

1306
01:12:28,118 --> 01:12:30,018
as former Colonel Nichols
well knows.

1307
01:12:30,019 --> 01:12:32,521
Our security was as tight as it could
be given the personalities involved,

1308
01:12:32,522 --> 01:12:34,223
but attempts were made.

1309
01:12:34,224 --> 01:12:36,825
- What is that supposed to mean?
- We've all read his file here.

1310
01:12:36,826 --> 01:12:40,029
Do we need to talk
about Jean Tatlock?

1311
01:12:40,730 --> 01:12:43,133
Or the Chevalier incident?

1312
01:12:47,437 --> 01:12:48,738
Excuse me.

1313
01:12:50,173 --> 01:12:53,376
That's Lomanitz, on line one.

1314
01:12:59,849 --> 01:13:00,949
Hello, Rossi.

1315
01:13:00,950 --> 01:13:04,187
What? Okay, just calm down.

1316
01:13:05,021 --> 01:13:06,488
There's been another screw-up.

1317
01:13:06,489 --> 01:13:08,090
Lomanitz just got drafted.

1318
01:13:08,091 --> 01:13:10,859
- We are at war, Doctor.
- Don't be an asshole, Nichols.

1319
01:13:10,860 --> 01:13:12,928
We need this kid.
Fix it, will you?

1320
01:13:12,929 --> 01:13:14,296
It wasn't a mistake.

1321
01:13:14,297 --> 01:13:15,831
Your friend Lomanitz
has been trying

1322
01:13:15,832 --> 01:13:17,199
to unionize the Radiation Lab.

1323
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:18,967
He promised to quit all that.

1324
01:13:18,968 --> 01:13:20,903
Well, he hasn't.

1325
01:13:20,904 --> 01:13:24,173
Security officer at Berkeley's
concerned about communist infiltration

1326
01:13:24,174 --> 01:13:26,308
through that union, the FA...

1327
01:13:26,309 --> 01:13:28,244
FAECT.

1328
01:13:30,380 --> 01:13:32,815
Well, I'm there next week,
I'll...

1329
01:13:32,816 --> 01:13:34,350
drop in to see him.

1330
01:13:36,119 --> 01:13:38,054
Your Q clearance came through.

1331
01:13:41,558 --> 01:13:45,395
It's important you not maintain or
renew any questionable associations.

1332
01:13:50,033 --> 01:13:51,934
Doctor,
did you think social contacts

1333
01:13:51,935 --> 01:13:56,271
between a person engaged on secret
war work and communists was dangerous?

1334
01:13:56,272 --> 01:14:00,075
My awareness of the danger
would be greater today.

1335
01:14:00,076 --> 01:14:02,811
I mean, it's fair to say
that during the war years,

1336
01:14:02,812 --> 01:14:06,449
you felt that such contacts
were potentially dangerous?

1337
01:14:12,956 --> 01:14:15,624
Were conceivably dangerous, yes.

1338
01:14:15,625 --> 01:14:19,429
I mean, really?
Known communists?

1339
01:14:22,031 --> 01:14:23,266
Look...

1340
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:28,671
I've had a lot of secrets
in my head for a long time.

1341
01:14:29,606 --> 01:14:31,273
Doesn't matter
who I associate with.

1342
01:14:31,274 --> 01:14:34,210
I don't talk
about those secrets.

1343
01:14:41,684 --> 01:14:43,419
You said in your statement

1344
01:14:44,454 --> 01:14:46,622
that you had to

1345
01:14:46,623 --> 01:14:49,125
see Jean Tatlock in 1943.

1346
01:14:50,727 --> 01:14:52,262
You left.

1347
01:14:53,530 --> 01:14:54,763
Not a word.

1348
01:14:54,764 --> 01:14:57,500
What did you think
that would do to me?

1349
01:14:58,701 --> 01:14:59,735
I wrote.

1350
01:14:59,736 --> 01:15:02,005
Pages of nothing.

1351
01:15:04,374 --> 01:15:06,209
Where did you go?

1352
01:15:07,744 --> 01:15:09,177
I can't tell you.
Why not?

1353
01:15:09,178 --> 01:15:11,080
Because you're a communist.

1354
01:15:13,550 --> 01:15:15,384
Why did you have to see her?

1355
01:15:15,385 --> 01:15:20,255
Because she had indicated a
great desire to see me before we left.

1356
01:15:20,256 --> 01:15:25,027
At that time, I couldn't, but I
felt that she had to see me.

1357
01:15:25,028 --> 01:15:27,829
She was undergoing
psychiatric treatment.

1358
01:15:27,830 --> 01:15:29,932
She was extremely unhappy.

1359
01:15:29,933 --> 01:15:32,368
Did you find out
why she had to see you?

1360
01:15:37,106 --> 01:15:39,409
Because she was still
in love with me.

1361
01:15:46,482 --> 01:15:48,518
Spent the night together,
didn't you?

1362
01:15:56,526 --> 01:15:57,627
Yes.

1363
01:16:03,900 --> 01:16:06,969
You drop in and out of my life

1364
01:16:06,970 --> 01:16:09,605
and you don't have to
tell me why.

1365
01:16:09,606 --> 01:16:10,973
Now, that's power.

1366
01:16:10,974 --> 01:16:13,642
Not that I enjoy.

1367
01:16:13,643 --> 01:16:16,244
I'd rather be here for you
as you need.

1368
01:16:16,245 --> 01:16:19,048
But you have
other priorities now.

1369
01:16:19,649 --> 01:16:21,517
I have a wife and child.

1370
01:16:22,518 --> 01:16:25,288
That's not what either of us
is talking about.

1371
01:16:28,858 --> 01:16:30,126
Jean.

1372
01:16:30,827 --> 01:16:32,462
You asked me to come.

1373
01:16:33,329 --> 01:16:35,231
And I'm glad I did.

1374
01:16:35,932 --> 01:16:37,900
But I can't see you again.

1375
01:16:40,937 --> 01:16:42,905
But what if I need you?

1376
01:16:46,442 --> 01:16:48,678
You said
you would always answer.

1377
01:16:51,547 --> 01:16:53,615
Not a word.

1378
01:16:53,616 --> 01:16:56,018
Did you think that
consistent with good security?

1379
01:16:56,019 --> 01:16:59,122
As a matter of fact, it was.
Not a word.

1380
01:17:00,523 --> 01:17:02,558
When did you see her after that?

1381
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:12,435
I never saw her again.

1382
01:17:18,675 --> 01:17:21,743
I can make the last train
back to Princeton.

1383
01:17:21,744 --> 01:17:24,246
Kitty, I didn't say anything
that I hadn't already told you.

1384
01:17:24,247 --> 01:17:28,051
Today you said it to history,
didn't you? This is a closed hearing.

1385
01:17:29,786 --> 01:17:32,688
If they don't release the
transcript, I'm sure you will.

1386
01:17:32,689 --> 01:17:33,855
I was under oath.

1387
01:17:33,856 --> 01:17:35,157
Well, you were
under an oath to me

1388
01:17:35,158 --> 01:17:37,026
when you went to see Jean.

1389
01:17:37,827 --> 01:17:39,362
You know, you...

1390
01:17:39,996 --> 01:17:41,596
you sit there,

1391
01:17:41,597 --> 01:17:42,632
day after day,

1392
01:17:43,533 --> 01:17:46,235
letting them
pick our lives to pieces.

1393
01:17:48,338 --> 01:17:50,139
Why won't you fight?

1394
01:17:53,343 --> 01:17:56,345
Robert, I'm not
putting her up there.

1395
01:18:01,684 --> 01:18:04,519
Dr. Oppenheimer, it's an honor.
Please, take a seat.

1396
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:06,621
No need, I just wanted to check

1397
01:18:06,622 --> 01:18:10,258
whether I should talk to Lomanitz
while I'm here, given your concerns.

1398
01:18:10,259 --> 01:18:13,628
Well, I'd say that's really up to
you, Professor, but I'd be cautious.

1399
01:18:13,629 --> 01:18:14,996
Uh-huh. Understood.

1400
01:18:14,997 --> 01:18:17,466
Oh, and, um...
...as regards to the union,

1401
01:18:17,467 --> 01:18:21,169
I wanted to give you a heads-up
on a man named Eltenton.

1402
01:18:21,170 --> 01:18:22,671
- A heads-up?
- Yes.

1403
01:18:22,672 --> 01:18:26,008
Just that he might
merit watching, is all.

1404
01:18:27,210 --> 01:18:28,777
I'd love to get more details.

1405
01:18:28,778 --> 01:18:31,880
Well, I have an appointment now,
and I leave early tomorrow.

1406
01:18:31,881 --> 01:18:36,018
Well, come back as early as you
like. Since you haven't time now.

1407
01:18:36,919 --> 01:18:38,653
You went back the next morning.

1408
01:18:38,654 --> 01:18:40,690
I did. I had to, really.

1409
01:18:41,491 --> 01:18:43,526
This time there was another man.

1410
01:18:45,027 --> 01:18:46,328
He said his name was Pash.

1411
01:18:46,329 --> 01:18:48,864
Pash. You met Colonel Pash?

1412
01:18:48,865 --> 01:18:51,900
Colonel Pash, could you
please read from your memo

1413
01:18:51,901 --> 01:18:54,437
dated June 29, 1943?

1414
01:18:55,805 --> 01:18:58,406
"Results of surveillance
conducted on subject

1415
01:18:58,407 --> 01:19:01,376
indicate further possible
Communist Party connections.

1416
01:19:01,377 --> 01:19:03,912
Subject met with, and spent
considerable time with,

1417
01:19:03,913 --> 01:19:05,881
one Jean Tatlock, communist,

1418
01:19:05,882 --> 01:19:07,315
the record of whom is attached."

1419
01:19:07,316 --> 01:19:10,018
- The subject being Dr. Oppenheimer?
- Yes.

1420
01:19:10,019 --> 01:19:11,453
Whom you had not met?

1421
01:19:11,454 --> 01:19:13,321
Not then, but soon after.

1422
01:19:13,322 --> 01:19:15,657
He's the head of security for
the project. Shouldn't I know him?

1423
01:19:15,658 --> 01:19:19,561
No, he should know you. I would
never put you in a room with Pash.

1424
01:19:19,562 --> 01:19:21,062
Why not?

1425
01:19:21,063 --> 01:19:22,764
When Pash first heard
about Lomanitz,

1426
01:19:22,765 --> 01:19:25,967
he told the FBI
he was gonna kidnap him,

1427
01:19:25,968 --> 01:19:27,636
take him out on a boat

1428
01:19:27,637 --> 01:19:30,406
and interrogate him
in the Russian manner.

1429
01:19:33,009 --> 01:19:35,377
General Groves has placed in me
a certain responsibility,

1430
01:19:35,378 --> 01:19:37,780
and it's like having a child
who I can't see.

1431
01:19:38,781 --> 01:19:40,283
By remote control.

1432
01:19:41,317 --> 01:19:42,852
So to actually meet you is...

1433
01:19:44,587 --> 01:19:47,255
- I won't take up too much of your time.
- No, not at all.

1434
01:19:47,256 --> 01:19:49,391
Whatever time you choose.

1435
01:19:49,392 --> 01:19:51,560
Mr. Johnson told me of a
conversation you had yesterday

1436
01:19:51,561 --> 01:19:53,061
in which I'm very interested.

1437
01:19:53,062 --> 01:19:55,096
It's had me worried all day.

1438
01:19:55,097 --> 01:19:58,800
Yes, well, I didn't want to talk to
Lomanitz without authorization.

1439
01:19:58,801 --> 01:20:00,802
That's not the particular
interest that I have.

1440
01:20:00,803 --> 01:20:02,638
It's something
a little bit more...

1441
01:20:04,006 --> 01:20:05,440
in my opinion, more serious.

1442
01:20:05,441 --> 01:20:08,243
Now, when the FBI pointed out
that such information

1443
01:20:08,244 --> 01:20:10,011
wouldn't be admissible in court,

1444
01:20:10,012 --> 01:20:12,981
Pash made it clear he had no
intention of leaving any witness left

1445
01:20:12,982 --> 01:20:14,049
to prosecute.

1446
01:20:14,050 --> 01:20:15,450
Now, the FBI talked him down,

1447
01:20:15,451 --> 01:20:16,952
but that's the man
you're dancing with.

1448
01:20:16,953 --> 01:20:19,788
I gather you've heard
there are other parties

1449
01:20:19,789 --> 01:20:22,457
interested in the work
of the Radiation Lab?

1450
01:20:22,458 --> 01:20:26,361
A man attached
to the Soviet Consul

1451
01:20:26,362 --> 01:20:29,431
indicated through
intermediate people

1452
01:20:29,432 --> 01:20:31,199
to people on this project

1453
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:33,001
that he was in a position

1454
01:20:33,002 --> 01:20:34,536
to transmit information.

1455
01:20:34,537 --> 01:20:37,306
Why would anyone on the project
wanna do that?

1456
01:20:38,808 --> 01:20:41,309
Frankly, I can see
that there might be an argument

1457
01:20:41,310 --> 01:20:43,678
for the commander-in-chief
informing the Russians.

1458
01:20:43,679 --> 01:20:45,747
They're our allies after all.

1459
01:20:45,748 --> 01:20:48,650
But I don't like the idea
of it going out the back door.

1460
01:20:48,651 --> 01:20:51,287
It might not hurt
to be on the lookout for it.

1461
01:20:52,221 --> 01:20:53,989
And you said that to Pash?

1462
01:20:53,990 --> 01:20:58,326
I was trying to put it in the
context of "Russia's not Germany."

1463
01:20:58,327 --> 01:21:02,998
Boris Pash is the son
of a Russian Orthodox bishop.

1464
01:21:02,999 --> 01:21:04,799
Born here, but in 1918,

1465
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:07,202
he went back to Russia
to fight the Bolsheviks.

1466
01:21:07,203 --> 01:21:10,138
This is a man who has killed
communists with his own hands.

1467
01:21:10,139 --> 01:21:13,508
I'm not the judge of who should
or should not have information.

1468
01:21:13,509 --> 01:21:16,244
It's my business to stop it
from going through illegally.

1469
01:21:16,245 --> 01:21:18,414
Would you be
a little more specific?

1470
01:21:20,449 --> 01:21:24,653
There's a man whose name was
mentioned to me a couple of times.

1471
01:21:24,654 --> 01:21:26,554
Eltenton.

1472
01:21:26,555 --> 01:21:29,925
Uh, I believe he's a chemist
who works at Shell.

1473
01:21:29,926 --> 01:21:32,894
He talked to a friend of his

1474
01:21:32,895 --> 01:21:36,232
who's an acquaintance
of someone on the project.

1475
01:21:37,567 --> 01:21:39,935
And you thought Pash
would be satisfied with that?

1476
01:21:39,936 --> 01:21:44,072
I was attempting to give them
Eltenton without opening a can of worms.

1477
01:21:44,073 --> 01:21:45,840
I told them
a cock-and-bull story.

1478
01:21:45,841 --> 01:21:47,509
Did you lie
to General Groves too?

1479
01:21:47,510 --> 01:21:50,979
No. I admitted to him
that I'd lied to Pash.

1480
01:21:50,980 --> 01:21:54,449
Do you recall this conversation
about the Chevalier incident?

1481
01:21:54,450 --> 01:21:57,285
I've seen
so many versions of it,

1482
01:21:57,286 --> 01:22:00,155
I wasn't confused before but
I'm certainly getting there now.

1483
01:22:00,156 --> 01:22:01,389
What was your conclusion?

1484
01:22:01,390 --> 01:22:03,792
That he was
under the influence of

1485
01:22:03,793 --> 01:22:06,695
the typical
American schoolboy attitude

1486
01:22:06,696 --> 01:22:10,332
that there's something wicked
about telling on a friend.

1487
01:22:10,333 --> 01:22:12,067
Well, now...

1488
01:22:12,068 --> 01:22:14,803
Might we know through whom
the contact was made?

1489
01:22:14,804 --> 01:22:19,307
That would involve people
who are not to be involved in this.

1490
01:22:19,308 --> 01:22:22,043
Is that someone
a member of the project?

1491
01:22:22,044 --> 01:22:27,083
- A member of the faculty, yes, but not in the project, no.
- Ah.

1492
01:22:27,550 --> 01:22:32,554
So Eltenton made his approach through
a member of the faculty here at Berkeley?

1493
01:22:34,390 --> 01:22:36,791
As far as I know...
As far as I know, yes.

1494
01:22:36,792 --> 01:22:38,961
But...
...there may have been

1495
01:22:39,662 --> 01:22:41,664
more than one person involved.

1496
01:22:46,268 --> 01:22:50,438
Gentlemen, if I... If I seem
uncooperative, I think you can understand

1497
01:22:50,439 --> 01:22:51,773
it's because of my insistence

1498
01:22:51,774 --> 01:22:54,376
in not getting innocent people
into trouble.

1499
01:22:54,377 --> 01:22:57,512
You're trying to protect your
friend. Who's protecting you?

1500
01:22:57,513 --> 01:23:00,248
- Well, you could.
- If you gave me the name.

1501
01:23:00,249 --> 01:23:01,816
If you order me to, I'll do it.

1502
01:23:01,817 --> 01:23:05,121
That is a mistake, Robert.
You need to volunteer this name.

1503
01:23:06,355 --> 01:23:08,823
- And did he give you the name?
- He did.

1504
01:23:08,824 --> 01:23:10,592
But not then, did he?
No.

1505
01:23:10,593 --> 01:23:12,994
No. In fact, it was some
months later, wasn't it?

1506
01:23:12,995 --> 01:23:14,295
It was.

1507
01:23:14,296 --> 01:23:16,765
- You see me as persistent.
- Well, you are...

1508
01:23:16,766 --> 01:23:18,800
You are persistent,
but that is your job.

1509
01:23:18,801 --> 01:23:22,303
And-And my job is to protect
the people that work for me.

1510
01:23:22,304 --> 01:23:26,575
Instead of us going on certain steps,
which may come to your attention...

1511
01:23:28,077 --> 01:23:29,844
and be disturbing to you,

1512
01:23:29,845 --> 01:23:32,647
I would like to discuss those
with you first.

1513
01:23:32,648 --> 01:23:36,852
I'm not formulating a plan. I'll
just have to digest the whole thing.

1514
01:23:40,890 --> 01:23:43,992
In the months in between your
interview with Dr. Oppenheimer

1515
01:23:43,993 --> 01:23:46,528
and his eventual
naming of Chevalier,

1516
01:23:46,529 --> 01:23:49,731
did you expend resources trying to
find the name of the intermediary?

1517
01:23:49,732 --> 01:23:52,100
Considerable resources, yes.

1518
01:23:52,101 --> 01:23:54,402
Without the name,
our job was extremely difficult.

1519
01:23:54,403 --> 01:23:56,004
And when did you
receive the name?

1520
01:23:56,005 --> 01:23:58,740
I was gone by the time
Oppenheimer finally offered it up.

1521
01:23:58,741 --> 01:24:02,043
- Gone?
- They felt my time would be better spent in Europe

1522
01:24:02,044 --> 01:24:04,412
determining the status
of the Nazi bomb project.

1523
01:24:04,413 --> 01:24:05,815
Who did?

1524
01:24:06,982 --> 01:24:08,050
General Groves.

1525
01:24:08,784 --> 01:24:10,586
He transferred me to London.

1526
01:24:17,026 --> 01:24:18,927
It's a little early
for a Christmas party.

1527
01:24:18,928 --> 01:24:22,531
Something's up.
Tolman's been away.

1528
01:24:23,365 --> 01:24:24,732
Where?

1529
01:24:24,733 --> 01:24:26,135
Ruth won't tell.

1530
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:32,107
Hey!

1531
01:24:36,078 --> 01:24:39,814
Come on, Ruthie. Can't
tell me, who can you tell?

1532
01:24:39,815 --> 01:24:41,650
Compartmentalization, Oppie.

1533
01:24:42,585 --> 01:24:44,652
What makes you think
I know where he is anyway?

1534
01:24:44,653 --> 01:24:46,521
'Cause you do
a pretty good job of knowing

1535
01:24:46,522 --> 01:24:48,657
where Mr. Tolman is
when it counts.

1536
01:24:49,158 --> 01:24:50,191
Like now?

1537
01:24:50,192 --> 01:24:53,529
Attention!

1538
01:24:56,165 --> 01:24:58,634
Early Christmas present
for you all.

1539
01:25:06,742 --> 01:25:09,043
The British pilots
put me in the bomb bay.

1540
01:25:09,044 --> 01:25:12,314
Showed me the-the oxygen,
you know, but I messed it up.

1541
01:25:13,849 --> 01:25:15,683
When they opened me up in
Scotland, I was unconscious.

1542
01:25:15,684 --> 01:25:18,720
But I pretended
I'd been napping.

1543
01:25:18,721 --> 01:25:20,523
Please enjoy your party.

1544
01:25:21,457 --> 01:25:22,957
Is it big enough?

1545
01:25:22,958 --> 01:25:24,493
To end the war?

1546
01:25:25,027 --> 01:25:27,162
To end all war.

1547
01:25:29,865 --> 01:25:34,435
Heisenberg sought me out
in Copenhagen.

1548
01:25:34,436 --> 01:25:37,906
It was chilling, my old
student working for the Nazis.

1549
01:25:37,907 --> 01:25:41,944
He told me some things
to draw me out.

1550
01:25:42,745 --> 01:25:45,680
Sustained fission reactions
in uranium.

1551
01:25:45,681 --> 01:25:47,815
That sounds more like
a reactor than a bomb.

1552
01:25:47,816 --> 01:25:49,684
Did he mention
gaseous diffusion?

1553
01:25:49,685 --> 01:25:52,120
He seemed more focused
on heavy water.

1554
01:25:52,121 --> 01:25:53,788
As a moderator?

1555
01:25:53,789 --> 01:25:55,257
Yes, instead of graphite.

1556
01:25:58,294 --> 01:25:59,762
What?

1557
01:26:00,596 --> 01:26:03,431
He took a wrong turn.
We're ahead.

1558
01:26:03,432 --> 01:26:05,233
And with you here
to help us, Niels...

1559
01:26:05,234 --> 01:26:09,238
Sorry, could you... could you
give us a moment, gentlemen?

1560
01:26:15,611 --> 01:26:18,413
I am not here to help, Robert.

1561
01:26:18,414 --> 01:26:20,648
I knew you could do this
without me.

1562
01:26:20,649 --> 01:26:22,617
Then why did you come?
To talk about after.

1563
01:26:22,618 --> 01:26:27,423
The power you're about to reveal
will forever outlive the Nazis.

1564
01:26:28,023 --> 01:26:30,225
And the world is not prepared.

1565
01:26:30,226 --> 01:26:33,194
"You could lift the stone without being
ready for the snake that's revealed."

1566
01:26:33,195 --> 01:26:35,330
We have to make
the politicians understand,

1567
01:26:35,331 --> 01:26:36,932
this isn't a new weapon.

1568
01:26:37,433 --> 01:26:38,833
It's a new world.

1569
01:26:38,834 --> 01:26:42,370
I'll be out there
doing what I can, but you...

1570
01:26:42,371 --> 01:26:45,073
You are an American Prometheus.

1571
01:26:45,074 --> 01:26:49,244
The man who gave them the power
to destroy themselves,

1572
01:26:49,245 --> 01:26:50,912
and they'll respect that.

1573
01:26:50,913 --> 01:26:53,182
Then your work really begins.

1574
01:26:57,653 --> 01:27:00,189
I'm sorry, Oppie,
but there's a call.

1575
01:27:01,790 --> 01:27:03,292
From San Francisco.

1576
01:27:10,332 --> 01:27:11,634
Robert?

1577
01:27:16,005 --> 01:27:17,472
Robert?

1578
01:27:17,473 --> 01:27:20,041
Robert. Robert.

1579
01:27:20,042 --> 01:27:21,709
Oh, my God.
What's the matter?

1580
01:27:21,710 --> 01:27:22,911
What happened?

1581
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:26,447
Her father called.

1582
01:27:26,448 --> 01:27:28,217
They found her yesterday
in the bath.

1583
01:27:30,052 --> 01:27:31,153
Who?

1584
01:27:32,488 --> 01:27:33,988
She'd taken pills.

1585
01:27:33,989 --> 01:27:35,491
Left a note, not signed.

1586
01:27:36,825 --> 01:27:40,062
She took barbiturates, but there
was chloral hydrate in her blood.

1587
01:27:43,499 --> 01:27:44,900
There was a note.

1588
01:27:45,501 --> 01:27:47,069
Jean Tatlock?

1589
01:27:53,609 --> 01:27:54,842
We were together.

1590
01:27:54,843 --> 01:27:57,212
She said she needed me. I...

1591
01:27:59,481 --> 01:28:02,017
I told her I...
...I wouldn't...

1592
01:28:02,685 --> 01:28:04,485
I told her I couldn't...

1593
01:28:04,486 --> 01:28:06,755
No, it was... it was me...

1594
01:28:07,890 --> 01:28:11,225
You don't get to commit the sin

1595
01:28:11,226 --> 01:28:14,997
and then have us all feel sorry
for you that it had consequences.

1596
01:28:18,033 --> 01:28:20,169
You pull yourself together.

1597
01:28:23,939 --> 01:28:26,108
You know,
people here depend on you.

1598
01:28:28,043 --> 01:28:30,178
Donald, would you like to
contribute here, please?

1599
01:28:30,179 --> 01:28:32,180
You're on your own, pal.

1600
01:28:32,181 --> 01:28:34,382
Bob, I'm not quitting my job
because plutonium is radioactive.

1601
01:28:34,383 --> 01:28:37,385
We just don't know what it might do
to the female reproductive system...

1602
01:28:37,386 --> 01:28:40,521
Your reproductive system
is more exposed than mine, presumably.

1603
01:28:40,522 --> 01:28:43,324
Can we please? The
implosion device is nowhere.

1604
01:28:43,325 --> 01:28:45,460
You can't rush everything.
Oppie, please.

1605
01:28:45,461 --> 01:28:47,795
Well, there's rushing and there's
getting on with it, so, pick one.

1606
01:28:47,796 --> 01:28:49,764
Wait. Neddermeyer's
doing his job.

1607
01:28:49,765 --> 01:28:52,333
Teller's not helping.
You're not helping.

1608
01:28:52,334 --> 01:28:55,036
I've been asking for calculations
on the implosion lenses for weeks.

1609
01:28:55,037 --> 01:28:57,605
- The British can do it. Fuchs.
- Absolutely.

1610
01:28:57,606 --> 01:29:01,109
- It's your job, Teller.
- I'm engaged in research.

1611
01:29:01,110 --> 01:29:03,712
On a hydrogen bomb
we're not even building.

1612
01:29:11,887 --> 01:29:13,288
I won't work for that man.

1613
01:29:14,990 --> 01:29:17,191
Let him go.
He's a prima Donna.

1614
01:29:17,192 --> 01:29:19,427
I agree.
He should leave Los Alamos.

1615
01:29:19,428 --> 01:29:21,295
Okay.

1616
01:29:21,296 --> 01:29:24,132
Kisty, you replace Neddermeyer.
Seth, I'm putting you on plutonium.

1617
01:29:24,133 --> 01:29:27,802
Lilli, you go work for Kisty,
because he needs you.

1618
01:29:27,803 --> 01:29:29,404
Fuchs, you take Teller's role.

1619
01:29:29,405 --> 01:29:32,507
I'm putting you exclusively
on the implosion device.

1620
01:29:32,508 --> 01:29:36,278
And no one
is leaving Los Alamos.

1621
01:29:50,559 --> 01:29:51,793
They won't let me leave.

1622
01:29:51,794 --> 01:29:54,029
No. I won't let you leave.

1623
01:29:55,564 --> 01:29:58,065
Forget Hans. Forget fission.

1624
01:29:58,066 --> 01:30:01,235
Stay here,
research what you want.

1625
01:30:01,236 --> 01:30:03,771
Fusion, the hydrogen bomb, whatever.

1626
01:30:03,772 --> 01:30:05,506
We'll meet to discuss.

1627
01:30:05,507 --> 01:30:08,009
You don't have time to meet.
You're a politician now, Robert.

1628
01:30:08,010 --> 01:30:10,913
You've left physics behind
many, many years ago.

1629
01:30:11,814 --> 01:30:13,514
Once a week.

1630
01:30:13,515 --> 01:30:15,384
One hour, you and me.

1631
01:30:21,090 --> 01:30:23,058
Now raise this fucking barrier.

1632
01:30:27,629 --> 01:30:31,599
So the Super was under development
on your watch at Los Alamos?

1633
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:33,134
Yes.

1634
01:30:33,135 --> 01:30:36,437
And yet, after the war,
you tried to deny it was viable.

1635
01:30:36,438 --> 01:30:39,574
No, no, no. I-I pointed out
technical difficulties with it.

1636
01:30:39,575 --> 01:30:41,809
Didn't you try to kill it
at the AEC meeting

1637
01:30:41,810 --> 01:30:43,511
- after the Russian bomb test?
- No.

1638
01:30:43,512 --> 01:30:46,481
But that was the recommendation
of the AEC, was it not?

1639
01:30:46,482 --> 01:30:49,851
After hours of discussion
about the best response.

1640
01:30:49,852 --> 01:30:54,890
An H-bomb is 1,000 times
the power of an A-bomb.

1641
01:30:55,691 --> 01:30:59,994
Its only intended target
would be the largest cities.

1642
01:30:59,995 --> 01:31:01,929
It's a weapon of mass genocide.

1643
01:31:01,930 --> 01:31:05,933
Izzy, draw some circles on this side
of the map where they would target us.

1644
01:31:05,934 --> 01:31:07,168
Starting with New York.

1645
01:31:07,169 --> 01:31:08,636
- That's fair.
- DC.

1646
01:31:08,637 --> 01:31:11,038
It's a weapon of attack
with no defensive value.

1647
01:31:11,039 --> 01:31:12,940
- Deterrence.
- "Deterrence"?

1648
01:31:12,941 --> 01:31:16,644
Do we really need more deterrence
than our current arsenal of atomic bombs?

1649
01:31:16,645 --> 01:31:20,948
Y-You drown in ten feet of water
or 10,000, what's the difference?

1650
01:31:20,949 --> 01:31:23,117
We can already drown Russia.
They know it.

1651
01:31:23,118 --> 01:31:25,821
- Now they can drown us.
- We're just escalating.

1652
01:31:29,358 --> 01:31:32,294
Robert? Robert.

1653
01:31:36,265 --> 01:31:37,999
As I said, Teller's designs

1654
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:41,235
are still as impractical
as they were during the war.

1655
01:31:41,236 --> 01:31:43,971
A hydrogen bomb can be made
to work, Oppie, you know that.

1656
01:31:43,972 --> 01:31:46,874
I don't believe we should commit
all our resources to that chance.

1657
01:31:46,875 --> 01:31:50,144
Then how would you have Truman
reassure the American people?

1658
01:31:50,145 --> 01:31:52,480
Simply by limiting
the spread of atomic weapons

1659
01:31:52,481 --> 01:31:55,750
through international control
on nuclear energy.

1660
01:31:55,751 --> 01:31:57,385
By which you mean
world government.

1661
01:31:57,386 --> 01:32:00,321
The United Nations,
as Roosevelt intended.

1662
01:32:00,322 --> 01:32:03,090
Well, I asked
what Truman should do, right?

1663
01:32:03,091 --> 01:32:04,825
The world's changed.

1664
01:32:04,826 --> 01:32:07,929
It's not fascism but communism
that now threatens our survival.

1665
01:32:07,930 --> 01:32:09,897
Lewis, do you understand,

1666
01:32:09,898 --> 01:32:11,432
if we build a hydrogen bomb,

1667
01:32:11,433 --> 01:32:13,868
the Russians will have no choice
but to build their own?

1668
01:32:13,869 --> 01:32:15,403
Could they
be working on one already,

1669
01:32:15,404 --> 01:32:18,639
based on information gathered
from a spy at Los Alamos?

1670
01:32:18,640 --> 01:32:20,274
No spy at Los Alamos.

1671
01:32:20,275 --> 01:32:22,276
Gentlemen. Let's not get
sidetracked. There wasn't?

1672
01:32:22,277 --> 01:32:25,613
I say we use this moment to gain
concessions from the Russians

1673
01:32:25,614 --> 01:32:28,849
by committing that we will
not build a hydrogen bomb.

1674
01:32:28,850 --> 01:32:30,451
Thereby revealing its existence.

1675
01:32:30,452 --> 01:32:32,587
Which you seem convinced
they already know.

1676
01:32:32,588 --> 01:32:36,123
All right. At this point,
I'd like the committee members

1677
01:32:36,124 --> 01:32:40,128
to meet in privacy
to finalize our recommendations.

1678
01:32:41,363 --> 01:32:43,531
I'm just not sure
you wanna go down this road.

1679
01:32:43,532 --> 01:32:44,932
Lewis, with respect,

1680
01:32:44,933 --> 01:32:47,502
we are the advisory committee,
we will give them our advice.

1681
01:32:52,874 --> 01:32:54,308
Dr. Oppenheimer?

1682
01:32:54,309 --> 01:32:55,610
Hi.

1683
01:32:55,611 --> 01:32:58,412
William Borden. Joint
Committee on Atomic Energy?

1684
01:32:58,413 --> 01:32:59,680
Oh, yes, yes.

1685
01:32:59,681 --> 01:33:01,249
During the war, I was a pilot.

1686
01:33:02,384 --> 01:33:05,119
One night,
flying back from a raid,

1687
01:33:05,120 --> 01:33:07,021
I saw an amazing sight,

1688
01:33:07,022 --> 01:33:08,823
like a meteor.

1689
01:33:08,824 --> 01:33:11,792
A V-2 rocket headed to England.

1690
01:33:11,793 --> 01:33:15,062
I can't help but imagine what it
will be for such an enemy rocket

1691
01:33:15,063 --> 01:33:18,000
to carry an atomic warhead.

1692
01:33:26,742 --> 01:33:30,512
Well, let's make sure we're not
the ones to make that possible.

1693
01:33:35,550 --> 01:33:38,253
Oppie, I don't think you
wanna go up against Strauss.

1694
01:33:38,987 --> 01:33:41,422
If we both speak,
they listen to me.

1695
01:33:41,423 --> 01:33:43,391
When you speak,
they hear a prophet.

1696
01:33:43,392 --> 01:33:45,326
When Strauss speaks,
they hear themselves.

1697
01:33:45,327 --> 01:33:47,461
They'll listen to a prophet.

1698
01:33:47,462 --> 01:33:50,264
A prophet can't be wrong.
Not once.

1699
01:33:50,265 --> 01:33:53,934
Didn't you accuse Oppenheimer of
sabotaging the development of the Super?

1700
01:33:53,935 --> 01:33:58,639
I was never one of those to
bandy around terms like "sabotage."

1701
01:33:58,640 --> 01:34:00,675
But Mr. Borden was?

1702
01:34:00,676 --> 01:34:02,443
As I understand it, possibly.

1703
01:34:02,444 --> 01:34:06,113
How was Mr. Borden able to put
together such a detailed indictment?

1704
01:34:06,114 --> 01:34:07,648
He was no longer
a government employee,

1705
01:34:07,649 --> 01:34:10,051
yet he appears to have had
unlimited access

1706
01:34:10,052 --> 01:34:11,786
to Dr. Oppenheimer's file.

1707
01:34:11,787 --> 01:34:14,388
Might Mr. Nichols have
given him access to the file?

1708
01:34:14,389 --> 01:34:16,557
Or someone else at the AEC?

1709
01:34:16,558 --> 01:34:19,393
That's a very serious
accusation, Senator.

1710
01:34:19,394 --> 01:34:20,961
Is it your intention to suggest

1711
01:34:20,962 --> 01:34:23,731
that Dr. Oppenheimer is
disloyal to the United States?

1712
01:34:23,732 --> 01:34:26,467
I've always assumed,
and still assume,

1713
01:34:26,468 --> 01:34:29,070
that he's loyal
to the United States.

1714
01:34:29,071 --> 01:34:30,738
I believe this.
And I shall believe it

1715
01:34:30,739 --> 01:34:33,340
until I see very conclusive
proof to the opposite.

1716
01:34:33,341 --> 01:34:38,013
Do you, or do you not believe that Dr.
Oppenheimer is a security risk?

1717
01:34:46,288 --> 01:34:49,590
And if I may, when Hitler blew
his brains out in that bunker,

1718
01:34:49,591 --> 01:34:53,060
it is my humble opinion that there
is no need for that bomb to be seen

1719
01:34:53,061 --> 01:34:54,730
anywhere except
for that test site.

1720
01:34:56,331 --> 01:34:58,032
We at least have to take
a moment to think about

1721
01:34:58,033 --> 01:35:01,570
whether the means justify
the ends any longer, because...

1722
01:35:04,106 --> 01:35:06,274
Germany is about to surrender.

1723
01:35:08,110 --> 01:35:12,313
It's no longer the enemy who
are the greatest threat to mankind.

1724
01:35:12,314 --> 01:35:13,582
It's our work.

1725
01:35:16,084 --> 01:35:18,653
Hitler is dead, it's true.

1726
01:35:20,389 --> 01:35:22,056
But the Japanese fight on.

1727
01:35:22,057 --> 01:35:23,724
Their defeat seems assured.

1728
01:35:23,725 --> 01:35:26,695
Not if you're a GI
preparing to invade.

1729
01:35:28,096 --> 01:35:29,663
We can end this war.

1730
01:35:29,664 --> 01:35:32,734
But how do we justify using
this weapon on human beings?

1731
01:35:35,937 --> 01:35:38,840
We're theorists, yes?

1732
01:35:39,875 --> 01:35:44,412
We imagine a future,
and our imaginings horrify us.

1733
01:35:45,480 --> 01:35:47,782
But they won't fear it
until they understand it,

1734
01:35:47,783 --> 01:35:50,584
and they won't understand it
until they've used it.

1735
01:35:50,585 --> 01:35:54,522
When the world learns the
terrible secret of Los Alamos,

1736
01:35:54,523 --> 01:35:57,925
our work here will ensure a
peace mankind has never seen.

1737
01:35:57,926 --> 01:36:01,295
A peace based on the kind
of international cooperation

1738
01:36:01,296 --> 01:36:03,665
that Roosevelt always envisaged.

1739
01:36:08,603 --> 01:36:11,706
- Progress?
- Two years and a billion dollars' worth?

1740
01:36:12,407 --> 01:36:14,175
Well, hard to put a price on it.

1741
01:36:14,176 --> 01:36:15,910
Not really.
Just add up the bills.

1742
01:36:15,911 --> 01:36:20,247
"Rural free deliveries." Eighty
babies delivered the first year.

1743
01:36:20,248 --> 01:36:22,783
This year we've had ten a month.

1744
01:36:22,784 --> 01:36:26,287
Birth control is a little out
of my jurisdiction, General.

1745
01:36:26,288 --> 01:36:27,621
- Clearly.
- General.

1746
01:36:27,622 --> 01:36:28,757
Kiddo.

1747
01:36:33,528 --> 01:36:36,798
Head down, every... Fuchs.
Head down.

1748
01:36:43,572 --> 01:36:45,506
That's the one.

1749
01:36:45,507 --> 01:36:48,376
Two viable bombs.
I need a date.

1750
01:36:51,179 --> 01:36:52,580
September.

1751
01:36:52,581 --> 01:36:53,614
July.

1752
01:36:53,615 --> 01:36:55,584
That's the sweet spot, gentlemen.

1753
01:36:56,184 --> 01:36:57,852
August.

1754
01:36:57,853 --> 01:36:59,353
July.

1755
01:36:59,354 --> 01:37:02,657
Test in July.
But I need my brother.

1756
01:37:06,695 --> 01:37:09,396
Frank knows the desert,
he's left politics behind,

1757
01:37:09,397 --> 01:37:11,833
he's been working with
Lawrence for two years now.

1758
01:37:18,840 --> 01:37:20,575
What do we call the test?

1759
01:37:21,776 --> 01:37:25,546
"Batter my heart,
three person'd God."

1760
01:37:25,547 --> 01:37:26,615
What?

1761
01:37:28,049 --> 01:37:29,284
Trinity.

1762
01:37:36,992 --> 01:37:40,394
You insisted on bringing on your
brother Frank, a known communist.

1763
01:37:40,395 --> 01:37:42,162
Former communist.

1764
01:37:42,163 --> 01:37:43,964
You brought
a known former communist

1765
01:37:43,965 --> 01:37:47,835
onto America's most secret
and important defense project.

1766
01:37:47,836 --> 01:37:51,105
I knew my brother
could be trusted. Absolutely.

1767
01:37:51,106 --> 01:37:54,575
And you felt your judgment was sound
on who on the team could be trusted.

1768
01:37:54,576 --> 01:37:58,613
Fuchs, head down.
Okay, everybody ready.

1769
01:38:07,656 --> 01:38:09,356
I hope you learned something.

1770
01:38:09,357 --> 01:38:12,026
Yeah, we learned we're gonna
need to be a lot further away.

1771
01:38:12,027 --> 01:38:13,928
Well, figure it out. Fast.

1772
01:38:13,929 --> 01:38:16,649
We leave for Washington in the
morning. We're gonna give them a date.

1773
01:38:31,546 --> 01:38:33,447
You're a long way
from Chicago, Leo.

1774
01:38:33,448 --> 01:38:36,150
If we don't act now, they're going
to use this thing against Japan.

1775
01:38:36,151 --> 01:38:39,753
We booked a meeting with
Truman, but somebody killed it.

1776
01:38:39,754 --> 01:38:42,289
You're meeting
the secretary of war.

1777
01:38:42,290 --> 01:38:43,791
Just because we're building it

1778
01:38:43,792 --> 01:38:45,894
doesn't mean we get
to decide how it's used.

1779
01:38:46,561 --> 01:38:48,496
History will judge us, Robert.

1780
01:38:49,564 --> 01:38:51,733
In Chicago,
we put together a petition.

1781
01:38:52,367 --> 01:38:54,002
I'm not getting into that.

1782
01:38:59,107 --> 01:39:02,009
Just tell me your concerns
and I'll relay them. My concerns?

1783
01:39:02,010 --> 01:39:05,579
Germany's defeated. Japan's
not going to hold out alone.

1784
01:39:05,580 --> 01:39:07,614
How could you know that?
You got us into this.

1785
01:39:07,615 --> 01:39:11,218
You and Einstein with your letter to
Roosevelt saying we could build a bomb.

1786
01:39:11,219 --> 01:39:15,389
Against Germany. That's not how
weapons manufacture works, Szilard.

1787
01:39:15,390 --> 01:39:16,924
Oppie, you have to help.

1788
01:39:16,925 --> 01:39:18,859
Fermi's in the meeting.
Lawrence is in the meeting.

1789
01:39:18,860 --> 01:39:21,762
They're not you. You're the
great salesman of science.

1790
01:39:21,763 --> 01:39:24,399
You can convince anyone
of anything.

1791
01:39:25,133 --> 01:39:26,368
Even yourself.

1792
01:39:27,002 --> 01:39:28,036
Excuse me.

1793
01:39:29,404 --> 01:39:32,806
The firestorm in Tokyo
killed 100,000 people.

1794
01:39:32,807 --> 01:39:34,408
Mostly civilians.

1795
01:39:34,409 --> 01:39:38,779
I worry about an America where we
do these things and no one protests.

1796
01:39:38,780 --> 01:39:42,116
Pearl Harbor and three years
of brutal conflict in the Pacific

1797
01:39:42,117 --> 01:39:44,585
bought us a lot of latitude
with the American public.

1798
01:39:44,586 --> 01:39:47,021
Enough to unleash
the atomic bomb?

1799
01:39:47,022 --> 01:39:50,491
The A-bomb might not cause as
much damage as the Tokyo bombings.

1800
01:39:50,492 --> 01:39:51,925
What are we estimating?

1801
01:39:51,926 --> 01:39:56,830
In a medium-sized city,
20,000 or 30,000 dead.

1802
01:39:56,831 --> 01:39:58,932
Yes, but don't underestimate

1803
01:39:58,933 --> 01:40:02,536
the psychological impact
of an atomic explosion.

1804
01:40:02,537 --> 01:40:06,940
A pillar of fire
10,000 feet tall.

1805
01:40:06,941 --> 01:40:10,277
Deadly neutron effects
for a mile. In all directions.

1806
01:40:10,278 --> 01:40:13,247
From one single device.

1807
01:40:13,248 --> 01:40:15,249
Dropped from
a barely noticed B-29,

1808
01:40:15,250 --> 01:40:20,288
the atomic bomb will be a
terrible revelation of divine power.

1809
01:40:20,689 --> 01:40:24,058
If that's true,
it would be definitive.

1810
01:40:24,059 --> 01:40:26,126
World War II would be over.

1811
01:40:26,127 --> 01:40:27,628
Our boys would come home.

1812
01:40:27,629 --> 01:40:28,997
Military targets?

1813
01:40:30,065 --> 01:40:32,266
Uh... There aren't
any big enough.

1814
01:40:32,267 --> 01:40:35,269
Perhaps a vital war plant

1815
01:40:35,270 --> 01:40:37,805
with workers housed nearby?

1816
01:40:37,806 --> 01:40:41,008
And we could issue a warning
to reduce civilian casualties.

1817
01:40:41,009 --> 01:40:43,210
They'd send everything
they have up against us,

1818
01:40:43,211 --> 01:40:44,812
and I'd be up in that plane.

1819
01:40:44,813 --> 01:40:48,048
But if we announce it
and it fails to go off,

1820
01:40:48,049 --> 01:40:50,584
we'd scupper any chance
of a Japanese surrender.

1821
01:40:50,585 --> 01:40:55,189
Is there no way to demonstrate a
bomb to Japan to provoke surrender?

1822
01:40:55,190 --> 01:40:59,560
We intend to demonstrate it
in the most unambiguous terms. Twice.

1823
01:40:59,561 --> 01:41:01,595
Once, to show
the weapon's power,

1824
01:41:01,596 --> 01:41:05,399
and a second to show that we can
keep doing this until they surrender.

1825
01:41:05,400 --> 01:41:08,969
We have a list of 12 cities
to choose from...

1826
01:41:08,970 --> 01:41:10,771
Sorry, 11.

1827
01:41:10,772 --> 01:41:12,739
I've taken Kyoto off the list

1828
01:41:12,740 --> 01:41:16,443
due to its cultural significance
to the Japanese people.

1829
01:41:16,444 --> 01:41:19,213
Also, my wife and I
honeymooned there.

1830
01:41:19,214 --> 01:41:20,715
It's a magnificent city.

1831
01:41:24,185 --> 01:41:25,953
Let me make this simple
for you, gentlemen.

1832
01:41:25,954 --> 01:41:28,322
According to my intelligence,
which I cannot share with you,

1833
01:41:28,323 --> 01:41:32,459
the Japanese people will not
surrender, under any circumstances,

1834
01:41:32,460 --> 01:41:36,697
short of a successful and total
invasion of the home islands.

1835
01:41:36,698 --> 01:41:39,233
Many lives will be lost,
American and Japanese.

1836
01:41:39,234 --> 01:41:43,437
The use of the atomic bomb
on Japanese cities will save lives.

1837
01:41:43,438 --> 01:41:47,107
- If we retain moral advantage.
- How so?

1838
01:41:47,108 --> 01:41:49,109
Well, if we use this weapon
without informing our allies,

1839
01:41:49,110 --> 01:41:51,812
they'll see it as a threat,
and we'll be in an arms race.

1840
01:41:51,813 --> 01:41:54,281
How open can we be
with the Soviets?

1841
01:41:54,282 --> 01:41:58,585
Secrecy won't stop the Soviets from
becoming part of the atomic world.

1842
01:41:58,586 --> 01:42:00,454
We've been told
they have no uranium.

1843
01:42:00,455 --> 01:42:03,690
You've been misinformed. A
Russian bomb is a matter of time.

1844
01:42:03,691 --> 01:42:07,328
The program needs to continue
at full pace after the war.

1845
01:42:07,962 --> 01:42:09,830
Secretary Stimson, if I may,

1846
01:42:09,831 --> 01:42:13,667
not all scientists on the
project are in agreement.

1847
01:42:13,668 --> 01:42:17,404
In fact, this might be a moment to
consider other opinions. If you talk...

1848
01:42:17,405 --> 01:42:20,207
The Manhattan Project
has been plagued from the start

1849
01:42:20,208 --> 01:42:23,777
by certain scientists
of doubtful discretion

1850
01:42:23,778 --> 01:42:25,212
and uncertain loyalty.

1851
01:42:25,213 --> 01:42:27,247
One of them just tried to meet
with the president.

1852
01:42:27,248 --> 01:42:30,384
Now, we need these men,
but as soon as it's practical,

1853
01:42:30,385 --> 01:42:32,886
we should sever any such
scientists from the program.

1854
01:42:32,887 --> 01:42:34,556
Wouldn't you agree, Doctor?

1855
01:42:35,790 --> 01:42:38,058
If a Russian bomb is inevitable,

1856
01:42:38,059 --> 01:42:41,161
perhaps we should invite
their top scientists to Trinity?

1857
01:42:41,162 --> 01:42:44,898
President Truman has no
intention of raising expectations

1858
01:42:44,899 --> 01:42:47,701
that Stalin be included
in the atomic project.

1859
01:42:47,702 --> 01:42:49,136
Informing him
of our breakthrough

1860
01:42:49,137 --> 01:42:51,338
and presenting it
as a means to win the war

1861
01:42:51,339 --> 01:42:53,040
need not make
unkeepable promises.

1862
01:42:53,041 --> 01:42:55,209
But the Potsdam
peace conference in July

1863
01:42:55,210 --> 01:42:59,112
will be President Truman's last
chance to have that conversation.

1864
01:42:59,113 --> 01:43:01,382
Can you give us
a working bomb by then?

1865
01:43:02,450 --> 01:43:06,054
Absolutely. We will test
fire before the conference.

1866
01:43:10,525 --> 01:43:15,530
Ground Zero, observation posts at
10,000 yards north, south and west.

1867
01:43:16,965 --> 01:43:18,198
Where do we trigger from?

1868
01:43:18,199 --> 01:43:20,133
South, 10,000.

1869
01:43:20,134 --> 01:43:23,403
And Base Camp
is ten miles south here.

1870
01:43:23,404 --> 01:43:28,443
And there's a further observation
post on... on that hill 20 miles away.

1871
01:43:28,910 --> 01:43:31,878
What's that, Frank?
Trigger lines already went in.

1872
01:43:31,879 --> 01:43:35,515
The Air Force requested
a line of lights for their B-29.

1873
01:43:35,516 --> 01:43:37,651
What B-29?
Our bomb's on the tower.

1874
01:43:37,652 --> 01:43:40,988
They wanna use the test to
confirm a safe operating distance.

1875
01:43:40,989 --> 01:43:43,824
- That's risky.
- Not as risky as dropping one over Japan

1876
01:43:43,825 --> 01:43:45,859
and hoping that we were right
about the blast radius.

1877
01:43:45,860 --> 01:43:48,061
Don't let them slow us down.
We're firing on the 15th.

1878
01:43:48,062 --> 01:43:50,765
The 15th? That's not...
The 15th.

1879
01:43:52,300 --> 01:43:53,334
The 15th.

1880
01:43:54,503 --> 01:43:56,603
So I'll be here
at South Observation point

1881
01:43:56,604 --> 01:43:58,905
with Frank and Kistiakowsky.

1882
01:43:58,906 --> 01:44:02,776
You'll all be assigned
to Base Camp, West Observation,

1883
01:44:02,777 --> 01:44:04,712
or Far Observation.

1884
01:44:14,222 --> 01:44:18,059
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Careful
with the knife. There, carefully.

1885
01:44:19,560 --> 01:44:23,830
- Are those safe distances?
- They're based on your calculations.

1886
01:44:23,831 --> 01:44:26,734
Time to stand behind
your science, Hans. Literally.

1887
01:44:50,191 --> 01:44:51,259
Yeah.

1888
01:44:56,464 --> 01:44:58,131
What about the radiation cloud?

1889
01:44:58,132 --> 01:45:01,201
Without high winds, it should
settle within two to three miles.

1890
01:45:01,202 --> 01:45:03,437
Evacuation measures
are in place.

1891
01:45:03,438 --> 01:45:06,741
But we need good weather
for visibility, so it has to be fine.

1892
01:45:07,875 --> 01:45:09,377
Everybody out.

1893
01:45:19,487 --> 01:45:21,288
We go on the night of the 15th.

1894
01:45:21,289 --> 01:45:25,325
It's a hard deadline, so if
anyone has anything, speak now.

1895
01:45:25,326 --> 01:45:27,527
Little, little more.
Okay, stop, stop.

1896
01:45:27,528 --> 01:45:31,833
Everybody, mattresses.
Put the mattress underneath.

1897
01:45:48,816 --> 01:45:51,652
Could use
a final implosion test.

1898
01:45:53,254 --> 01:45:55,923
- It couldn't hurt.
- Do it.

1899
01:45:56,891 --> 01:45:59,293
Is there anything else
that might stop us?

1900
01:46:33,961 --> 01:46:35,830
It's happening, isn't it?

1901
01:46:37,732 --> 01:46:39,300
I'll send a message.

1902
01:46:39,867 --> 01:46:41,435
If it's gone our way...

1903
01:46:42,904 --> 01:46:44,172
take in the sheets.

1904
01:46:48,276 --> 01:46:49,343
Robert.

1905
01:46:52,480 --> 01:46:53,748
Break a leg.

1906
01:47:06,794 --> 01:47:08,029
Okay.

1907
01:47:59,714 --> 01:48:03,083
Oppie's taken
a very modest three kilotons.

1908
01:48:03,084 --> 01:48:05,552
- Teller's in with 45.
- Twenty.

1909
01:48:05,553 --> 01:48:07,621
20,000 tons of TNT.

1910
01:48:07,622 --> 01:48:11,325
And does anyone want the side
action on atmospheric ignition?

1911
01:48:13,661 --> 01:48:17,063
- Are you saying we'll have to delay?
- I'm saying it would be prudent.

1912
01:48:17,064 --> 01:48:19,166
This weather,
has it reached the site?

1913
01:48:24,305 --> 01:48:26,206
Bethe is calling to tell you
the implosion test failed.

1914
01:48:26,207 --> 01:48:29,110
Hello, Hans. Yes, he's here.

1915
01:48:30,311 --> 01:48:31,345
Yes.

1916
01:48:33,681 --> 01:48:35,448
- Is he wrong?
- No.

1917
01:48:35,449 --> 01:48:37,318
- No?
- No.

1918
01:48:38,085 --> 01:48:40,487
- So we're about to fire a dud?
- No.

1919
01:48:40,488 --> 01:48:44,057
- Explain.
- Well, I can't. I just... I just know.

1920
01:48:44,058 --> 01:48:45,859
I know the implosion lenses
will work.

1921
01:48:45,860 --> 01:48:48,094
If we fire these detonators
and they don't trigger a reaction,

1922
01:48:48,095 --> 01:48:51,431
two years' worth of plutonium will
be scattered across White Sands.

1923
01:48:51,432 --> 01:48:55,036
A month of my salary
against ten bucks says it lights.

1924
01:48:55,636 --> 01:48:56,636
Jesus.

1925
01:49:03,511 --> 01:49:05,879
The wind's picking up
at Zero, not the rain.

1926
01:49:05,880 --> 01:49:07,180
Lightning circling.

1927
01:49:07,181 --> 01:49:08,715
You think it might be time
to tell your men

1928
01:49:08,716 --> 01:49:11,719
to get away from the steel tower
with the atomic bomb?

1929
01:49:14,689 --> 01:49:17,457
- Let's get to South Observation.
- Pull 'em out.

1930
01:49:17,458 --> 01:49:19,994
We can make
our determination there.

1931
01:49:24,699 --> 01:49:26,833
The team
hasn't slept in two nights.

1932
01:49:26,834 --> 01:49:30,370
If we stand down, make the bomb
safe, we won't be back here for weeks.

1933
01:49:30,371 --> 01:49:34,207
Then we'll miss Potsdam. I
gotta get word to Truman by 7:00.

1934
01:49:34,208 --> 01:49:36,242
Our window's closing.
What is this doing?

1935
01:49:36,243 --> 01:49:37,744
Raining, blowing, lightning.

1936
01:49:37,745 --> 01:49:39,813
- For how long, damn it?
- It's holdin' strong.

1937
01:49:39,814 --> 01:49:42,215
It'll break before dawn.
How could you know that?

1938
01:49:42,216 --> 01:49:44,284
I know this desert.
Storm cools overnight.

1939
01:49:44,285 --> 01:49:46,386
Just before dawn,
the storm breaks.

1940
01:49:46,387 --> 01:49:48,788
He could be right, but
schedule as late as possible.

1941
01:49:48,789 --> 01:49:50,390
5:30.

1942
01:49:50,391 --> 01:49:52,392
Sign your forecast.
If you're wrong, I'll hang you.

1943
01:49:52,393 --> 01:49:54,828
- Frank, tell them all, 5:30.
- 5:30.

1944
01:49:54,829 --> 01:49:56,230
5:30.
5:30.

1945
01:49:58,733 --> 01:50:00,533
Three years,

1946
01:50:00,534 --> 01:50:01,868
4,000 people,

1947
01:50:01,869 --> 01:50:03,703
two billion dollars.

1948
01:50:03,704 --> 01:50:06,006
Well, if it doesn't go off,

1949
01:50:06,007 --> 01:50:07,508
we're both finished.

1950
01:50:10,177 --> 01:50:12,746
I'm betting on three kilotons.

1951
01:50:12,747 --> 01:50:15,615
Anything less,
they won't get what it is.

1952
01:50:15,616 --> 01:50:19,152
What did Fermi mean
by "atmospheric ignition"?

1953
01:50:19,153 --> 01:50:20,887
Well, we had a moment
where it looked like

1954
01:50:20,888 --> 01:50:24,592
the chain reaction from an
atomic device might never stop.

1955
01:50:25,226 --> 01:50:27,327
Setting fire to the atmosphere.

1956
01:50:27,328 --> 01:50:30,131
Why is Fermi still
taking side bets on it?

1957
01:50:30,698 --> 01:50:32,700
Call it gallows humor.

1958
01:50:35,136 --> 01:50:40,073
Wait, are we saying there's a
chance that when we push that button,

1959
01:50:40,074 --> 01:50:41,841
we destroy the world?

1960
01:50:41,842 --> 01:50:45,245
Nothing in our research over
three years supports that conclusion.

1961
01:50:45,246 --> 01:50:48,315
Except as
the most remote possibility.

1962
01:50:49,083 --> 01:50:51,252
- How remote?
- Chances are near zero.

1963
01:50:52,687 --> 01:50:53,721
Near zero.

1964
01:50:54,922 --> 01:50:57,425
What do you want
from theory alone?

1965
01:50:59,060 --> 01:51:01,195
Zero would be nice.

1966
01:51:04,298 --> 01:51:09,303
In exactly one hour,
58 minutes, we'll know.

1967
01:51:17,111 --> 01:51:18,446
It's letting up.

1968
01:51:30,991 --> 01:51:33,626
The arming party's left Zero,
they're heading this way.

1969
01:51:33,627 --> 01:51:34,794
Throwing the switches.

1970
01:51:34,795 --> 01:51:37,932
Turn the cars.
Ready for emergency evacuation.

1971
01:51:55,483 --> 01:51:57,117
Take your welder's glass.

1972
01:51:57,118 --> 01:51:59,119
Everybody, take your places.

1973
01:51:59,120 --> 01:52:01,255
Everybody take a welder's glass!

1974
01:52:02,623 --> 01:52:04,725
Everybody take a welder's glass.

1975
01:52:56,210 --> 01:52:57,645
Twenty minutes.

1976
01:53:01,415 --> 01:53:02,750
Twenty minutes.

1977
01:53:13,861 --> 01:53:15,362
That's 20.

1978
01:53:18,299 --> 01:53:20,134
On the leg, please.

1979
01:53:21,268 --> 01:53:23,169
Feynman.
No.

1980
01:53:23,170 --> 01:53:25,972
For your eyes, sir.
The glass stops the UV.

1981
01:53:25,973 --> 01:53:27,741
And what stops the glass?

1982
01:53:29,243 --> 01:53:31,879
I'm gonna head to Base Camp.
Best of luck.

1983
01:53:32,613 --> 01:53:34,215
Robert,

1984
01:53:35,149 --> 01:53:36,750
try not to blow up the world.

1985
01:53:48,429 --> 01:53:49,596
Watch that needle.

1986
01:53:49,597 --> 01:53:51,297
If the detonators don't charge,

1987
01:53:51,298 --> 01:53:53,233
or the voltage drops
below one volt,

1988
01:53:53,234 --> 01:53:54,901
you hit that button, you abort.

1989
01:53:54,902 --> 01:53:56,636
Understood?

1990
01:53:56,637 --> 01:53:57,838
Understood.

1991
01:54:04,912 --> 01:54:07,413
Two minutes to detonation.

1992
01:54:07,414 --> 01:54:09,215
Everybody down.

1993
01:54:09,216 --> 01:54:13,553
Do not turn around until you
see light reflected on the hills.

1994
01:54:13,554 --> 01:54:16,556
Then look at the explosion
only through your welder's glass.

1995
01:54:16,557 --> 01:54:18,993
Ninety seconds to detonation.

1996
01:54:20,761 --> 01:54:23,830
Eighty seconds to detonation.

1997
01:54:23,831 --> 01:54:25,399
Is it rubbed in?

1998
01:54:25,966 --> 01:54:27,201
Yeah.

1999
01:54:33,674 --> 01:54:36,844
Sixty seconds to detonation.

2000
01:54:51,458 --> 01:54:53,660
These things
are hard on your heart.

2001
01:54:53,661 --> 01:54:55,296
Thirty seconds.

2002
01:55:00,501 --> 01:55:01,935
Detonator's charged.

2003
01:55:12,179 --> 01:55:16,549
17, 16, 15...

2004
01:55:16,550 --> 01:55:21,588
14, 13, 12, 11...

2005
01:55:23,691 --> 01:55:24,858
Ten...

2006
01:55:26,160 --> 01:55:28,227
...nine,

2007
01:55:28,228 --> 01:55:29,630
eight...

2008
01:55:30,230 --> 01:55:31,632
seven...

2009
01:55:32,933 --> 01:55:34,401
six...

2010
01:55:35,336 --> 01:55:36,570
five...

2011
01:55:38,405 --> 01:55:39,707
four...

2012
01:55:41,208 --> 01:55:42,576
three...

2013
01:55:43,177 --> 01:55:44,545
two...

2014
01:55:46,013 --> 01:55:47,314
one.

2015
01:57:19,773 --> 01:57:22,342
"And now I am become Death."

2016
01:57:24,578 --> 01:57:26,513
"The destroyer of worlds."

2017
01:57:59,880 --> 01:58:00,914
It worked.

2018
01:58:36,416 --> 01:58:38,418
You owe me ten dollars!
Oh!

2019
01:58:40,554 --> 01:58:41,821
Come on!

2020
01:58:41,822 --> 01:58:44,357
I... I'm good for it, Kisty.

2021
01:58:44,358 --> 01:58:45,692
You are.

2022
01:58:46,260 --> 01:58:48,395
Yes, you are!

2023
01:59:16,490 --> 01:59:19,059
We did it! Well done.

2024
01:59:24,932 --> 01:59:26,934
Get me Potsdam right away.

2025
01:59:38,111 --> 01:59:40,880
Get a message to Kitty.
We can't say anything.

2026
01:59:40,881 --> 01:59:42,783
Tell her to take in the sheets.

2027
01:59:57,030 --> 01:59:57,965
Shh.

2028
01:59:57,966 --> 01:59:59,699
- Hello?
- Hi. Kitty?

2029
01:59:59,700 --> 02:00:02,668
What... What? Charlotte.
Charlotte, go ahead, go ahead.

2030
02:00:02,669 --> 02:00:07,574
Oh, um, well, I don't know, he just
said to tell you to "bring in the sheets."

2031
02:00:10,277 --> 02:00:11,511
Kitty?

2032
02:00:12,846 --> 02:00:15,649
Kitty? Kitty,
are you still there?

2033
02:00:22,356 --> 02:00:25,625
If they detonate it too high in the
air, the blast won't be as powerful.

2034
02:00:25,626 --> 02:00:28,027
With respect, Dr. Oppenheimer,

2035
02:00:28,028 --> 02:00:29,730
we'll take it from here.

2036
02:00:39,973 --> 02:00:42,942
Did Truman brief Stalin
at Potsdam?

2037
02:00:42,943 --> 02:00:45,611
A brief would be
an overstatement.

2038
02:00:45,612 --> 02:00:49,915
He referred to
a powerful new weapon.

2039
02:00:49,916 --> 02:00:54,954
Stalin hoped we'd use it
against Japan.

2040
02:00:56,189 --> 02:00:57,690
That's it?

2041
02:00:57,691 --> 02:00:59,625
Robert, we've given them an ace,

2042
02:00:59,626 --> 02:01:01,595
it's for them to play the hand.

2043
02:01:03,363 --> 02:01:05,164
You're aiming for the 6th?

2044
02:01:05,165 --> 02:01:07,901
Well, it's up to the CO
in the Pacific.

2045
02:01:09,102 --> 02:01:11,038
Should I come with you
to Washington?

2046
02:01:12,639 --> 02:01:13,974
What for?

2047
02:01:16,143 --> 02:01:18,011
Well, you'll keep me informed.

2048
02:01:19,246 --> 02:01:20,280
Of course.

2049
02:01:22,449 --> 02:01:23,717
As best I can.

2050
02:01:41,535 --> 02:01:44,705
Would the Japanese surrender
if they knew what was coming?

2051
02:01:45,672 --> 02:01:47,074
I don't know.

2052
02:01:49,443 --> 02:01:51,477
Have you seen
Szilard's petition?

2053
02:01:51,478 --> 02:01:54,046
What the hell does Szilard
know about the Japanese?

2054
02:01:54,047 --> 02:01:55,582
You're not signing it, are you?

2055
02:01:56,383 --> 02:01:58,984
Many people have.
A lot of people have.

2056
02:01:58,985 --> 02:02:00,187
Edward,

2057
02:02:01,521 --> 02:02:02,922
the fact that we built this bomb

2058
02:02:02,923 --> 02:02:06,025
does not give us any more
right or responsibility

2059
02:02:06,026 --> 02:02:08,260
to decide how it's used
than anyone else.

2060
02:02:08,261 --> 02:02:10,363
But we're the only people
who know about it.

2061
02:02:10,364 --> 02:02:13,999
I've told Stimson the various
opinions of the community.

2062
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:15,335
But what's your opinion?

2063
02:02:16,803 --> 02:02:18,205
Once it's used...

2064
02:02:19,206 --> 02:02:23,076
nuclear war, perhaps all war...

2065
02:02:24,511 --> 02:02:25,911
becomes unthinkable.

2066
02:02:25,912 --> 02:02:28,882
Until somebody builds
a bigger bomb.

2067
02:02:49,636 --> 02:02:51,337
I thought they would call.

2068
02:02:51,338 --> 02:02:52,973
It's only the 5th.

2069
02:02:55,142 --> 02:02:57,110
In Japan, it's the 6th.

2070
02:03:10,123 --> 02:03:11,158
Charlotte.

2071
02:03:13,627 --> 02:03:15,228
Try Groves.

2072
02:03:16,229 --> 02:03:17,264
Anything?

2073
02:03:19,332 --> 02:03:20,800
Charlotte?

2074
02:03:20,801 --> 02:03:22,302
Truman's on the radio.

2075
02:03:23,236 --> 02:03:25,871
Sixteen hours ago,

2076
02:03:25,872 --> 02:03:30,910
an American airplane dropped
one bomb on Hiroshima...

2077
02:03:33,113 --> 02:03:36,283
...and destroyed
its usefulness to the enemy.

2078
02:03:38,151 --> 02:03:43,189
The bomb had more power
than 20,000 tons of TNT.

2079
02:03:46,159 --> 02:03:48,128
It is an atomic bomb.

2080
02:03:50,730 --> 02:03:55,769
It is a harnessing of the
basic power of the universe.

2081
02:03:57,838 --> 02:03:59,071
Groves on one.

2082
02:03:59,072 --> 02:04:00,906
We are now prepared to destroy,

2083
02:04:00,907 --> 02:04:04,343
more rapidly and completely,
the Japanese...

2084
02:04:04,344 --> 02:04:06,212
General?

2085
02:04:06,213 --> 02:04:09,315
I'm very proud of you
and all of your people.

2086
02:04:09,316 --> 02:04:10,783
It went all right?

2087
02:04:10,784 --> 02:04:13,186
Apparently, it went
with a tremendous bang.

2088
02:04:14,254 --> 02:04:18,325
Well, everyone here is feeling
reasonably good about it.

2089
02:04:20,026 --> 02:04:21,560
It's been a long road.

2090
02:04:21,561 --> 02:04:24,163
I think one of the
wisest things I ever did

2091
02:04:24,164 --> 02:04:26,833
was when I selected
the director of Los Alamos.

2092
02:04:29,536 --> 02:04:33,606
We have spent
more than two billion dollars

2093
02:04:33,607 --> 02:04:37,611
on the greatest scientific
gamble in history,

2094
02:04:38,145 --> 02:04:40,280
and we have won.

2095
02:04:44,718 --> 02:04:48,187
Oppie! Oppie!
Oppie! Oppie!

2096
02:04:48,188 --> 02:04:56,188
Oppie! Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!

2097
02:06:08,435 --> 02:06:09,602
The world...

2098
02:06:11,271 --> 02:06:12,672
will remember this day.

2099
02:06:31,992 --> 02:06:33,859
It's too soon to...

2100
02:06:33,860 --> 02:06:38,131
It's too soon to determine what
the results of the bombing are.

2101
02:06:40,767 --> 02:06:42,836
But I'll bet
the Japanese didn't like it.

2102
02:07:03,723 --> 02:07:05,392
I'm so proud.

2103
02:07:06,226 --> 02:07:08,194
So proud of
what you have accomplished.

2104
02:07:15,702 --> 02:07:18,605
I just wish we had it in time
to use against the Germans.

2105
02:09:08,348 --> 02:09:10,049
Dr. Oppenheimer?

2106
02:09:10,917 --> 02:09:12,084
Dr. Oppenheimer?

2107
02:09:12,085 --> 02:09:14,354
Nice picture.

2108
02:09:15,054 --> 02:09:17,056
President Truman
will see you now.

2109
02:09:31,070 --> 02:09:33,906
Dr. Oppenheimer.
It's an honor.

2110
02:09:33,907 --> 02:09:35,874
Mr. President. Please.

2111
02:09:35,875 --> 02:09:37,243
Thank you.

2112
02:09:37,744 --> 02:09:39,078
Secretary Byrnes.

2113
02:09:41,181 --> 02:09:44,384
How's it feel to be the most
famous man in the world?

2114
02:09:45,251 --> 02:09:48,487
You helped save
a lot of American lives.

2115
02:09:48,488 --> 02:09:52,659
What we did at Hiroshima
was a... And Nagasaki.

2116
02:09:53,827 --> 02:09:55,694
Well, obviously.

2117
02:09:55,695 --> 02:09:59,031
Your invention
let us bring our boys home.

2118
02:09:59,032 --> 02:10:01,200
Well, it was hardly...

2119
02:10:01,201 --> 02:10:02,401
my invention.

2120
02:10:02,402 --> 02:10:04,437
It was you on the cover of Time.

2121
02:10:07,273 --> 02:10:10,876
Jim tells me you're concerned
about an arms race with the Soviets.

2122
02:10:10,877 --> 02:10:12,545
Oh, yes, uh...

2123
02:10:13,980 --> 02:10:15,247
Well, um...

2124
02:10:15,248 --> 02:10:16,582
It's that, uh,

2125
02:10:16,583 --> 02:10:20,586
now is our chance to secure...

2126
02:10:20,587 --> 02:10:23,522
international cooperation on...
...atomic energy

2127
02:10:23,523 --> 02:10:25,724
a-a-and I'm concerned...

2128
02:10:25,725 --> 02:10:28,694
Do you know when the Soviets
are gonna have the bomb?

2129
02:10:28,695 --> 02:10:30,829
I don't think
I could give a precise...

2130
02:10:30,830 --> 02:10:32,298
Never.

2131
02:10:32,932 --> 02:10:34,399
Never.

2132
02:10:34,400 --> 02:10:37,703
Mr. President, the Russians
have good physicists

2133
02:10:37,704 --> 02:10:40,405
a-a-and abundant resources.
Abundant?

2134
02:10:40,406 --> 02:10:41,674
Yes.

2135
02:10:42,342 --> 02:10:44,309
I don't think so.

2136
02:10:44,310 --> 02:10:48,214
Well, they'll put everything
they have in...

2137
02:10:51,651 --> 02:10:56,488
I hear you're leaving
Los Alamos.

2138
02:10:56,489 --> 02:10:57,956
What should we do with it?

2139
02:10:57,957 --> 02:11:00,326
Give it back to the Indians.

2140
02:11:07,834 --> 02:11:10,869
Um, Dr. Oppenheimer,

2141
02:11:10,870 --> 02:11:14,039
if what you say
about the Soviets is true,

2142
02:11:14,040 --> 02:11:18,578
we have to build up Los Alamos,
not shut it down.

2143
02:11:22,115 --> 02:11:23,816
Mr. President...

2144
02:11:24,951 --> 02:11:26,286
Um...

2145
02:11:29,122 --> 02:11:32,925
I feel that I have
blood on my hands.

2146
02:11:52,478 --> 02:11:57,483
You think anyone
in Hiroshima or Nagasaki

2147
02:11:57,750 --> 02:12:00,920
gives a shit who built the bomb?

2148
02:12:04,157 --> 02:12:06,693
They care who dropped it.

2149
02:12:07,293 --> 02:12:08,528
I did.

2150
02:12:11,230 --> 02:12:13,833
Hiroshima isn't about you.

2151
02:12:20,173 --> 02:12:21,641
Dr. Oppenheimer.

2152
02:12:32,919 --> 02:12:35,521
Don't let that crybaby
back in here.

2153
02:12:40,793 --> 02:12:43,862
Robert saw that
hand-wringing got him nowhere.

2154
02:12:43,863 --> 02:12:46,932
By the time I met him,
he'd fully embraced

2155
02:12:46,933 --> 02:12:49,768
his "father of the bomb"
reputation.

2156
02:12:49,769 --> 02:12:52,305
And he used his profile
to influence policy.

2157
02:13:00,980 --> 02:13:03,048
Doctor, in the years
following the war,

2158
02:13:03,049 --> 02:13:05,384
would you say that
you exerted a great influence

2159
02:13:05,385 --> 02:13:07,152
on the atomic policies
of the USA?

2160
02:13:07,153 --> 02:13:09,855
I think "great" would be
an overstatement.

2161
02:13:09,856 --> 02:13:12,090
Really?
If we look at the issue of isotopes,

2162
02:13:12,091 --> 02:13:15,560
were you not personally responsible for
destroying all opposition to their export?

2163
02:13:15,561 --> 02:13:18,163
You could use
a bottle of beer...

2164
02:13:18,164 --> 02:13:19,364
...when making atomic weapons.

2165
02:13:19,365 --> 02:13:20,432
In fact, you do.

2166
02:13:20,433 --> 02:13:21,800
I was the spokesman,

2167
02:13:21,801 --> 02:13:24,269
but the opinion among scientists
was unanimous.

2168
02:13:24,270 --> 02:13:27,774
All along with McCarthy on the
rise, he knew he was vulnerable.

2169
02:13:28,508 --> 02:13:29,708
His brother was blacklisted

2170
02:13:29,709 --> 02:13:32,445
by every university
in the country.

2171
02:13:33,613 --> 02:13:36,949
Lomanitz wound up working
the railroad, laying track.

2172
02:13:38,484 --> 02:13:40,920
And Chevalier went into exile.

2173
02:13:42,555 --> 02:13:46,491
But none of that stopped Robert
from pushing the GAC

2174
02:13:46,492 --> 02:13:49,095
to recommend arms control
instead of the H-bomb.

2175
02:13:51,130 --> 02:13:54,767
He was devastated when Truman
rejected their recommendation.

2176
02:13:56,636 --> 02:13:58,403
I miss Richard
more than I can bear.

2177
02:13:58,404 --> 02:14:00,272
I know, Ruth, I know.

2178
02:14:00,273 --> 02:14:03,976
Part of me's glad he didn't
live to see where this is all going.

2179
02:14:06,779 --> 02:14:09,815
Here comes the birthday boy.
To gloat.

2180
02:14:09,816 --> 02:14:10,883
Have fun.

2181
02:14:11,784 --> 02:14:13,785
Robert, uh,
my son and his fiancée

2182
02:14:13,786 --> 02:14:16,321
are desperate to meet the father
of the atomic bomb, and so...

2183
02:14:16,322 --> 02:14:18,658
Well... good day.

2184
02:14:25,465 --> 02:14:27,265
Is this a bad time?

2185
02:14:27,266 --> 02:14:28,733
What do you think, Lewis?

2186
02:14:28,734 --> 02:14:31,403
Well, I think it must
have been a blow for you.

2187
02:14:31,404 --> 02:14:32,705
For the world.

2188
02:14:33,973 --> 02:14:37,410
The world? What does Fuchs
mean to the rest of the world?

2189
02:14:38,811 --> 02:14:40,178
Fuchs?

2190
02:14:40,179 --> 02:14:41,747
Klaus Fuchs?

2191
02:14:43,249 --> 02:14:45,651
Oh, dear. You haven't heard.

2192
02:14:48,588 --> 02:14:50,655
Klaus Fuchs,
the British scientist

2193
02:14:50,656 --> 02:14:53,692
that you put onto the
implosion team at Los Alamos,

2194
02:14:53,693 --> 02:14:58,731
turns out he was spying for
the Soviets the whole time.

2195
02:14:59,298 --> 02:15:00,700
I'm sorry.

2196
02:15:06,005 --> 02:15:08,874
After the truth
about Fuchs came out,

2197
02:15:08,875 --> 02:15:11,143
the FBI stepped up
surveillance on him.

2198
02:15:11,144 --> 02:15:13,678
He knew his phone was tapped,

2199
02:15:13,679 --> 02:15:15,748
he was followed everywhere,

2200
02:15:16,382 --> 02:15:18,117
his trash picked through.

2201
02:15:21,053 --> 02:15:25,257
- But never stopped speaking his mind.
- A man of conviction.

2202
02:15:25,258 --> 02:15:28,661
And maybe he thought fame
could actually protect him.

2203
02:15:30,630 --> 02:15:33,766
When Eisenhower took office,
he saw one more chance.

2204
02:15:34,634 --> 02:15:36,301
He took it.

2205
02:15:36,302 --> 02:15:41,340
America and Russia may be
likened to two scorpions in a bottle,

2206
02:15:42,875 --> 02:15:46,444
each capable
of killing the other,

2207
02:15:46,445 --> 02:15:49,114
but only at the risk
of his own life.

2208
02:15:49,115 --> 02:15:51,883
Now, there are various aspects
of this policy...

2209
02:15:51,884 --> 02:15:53,985
Lot of scientists blame me,

2210
02:15:53,986 --> 02:15:56,955
but how was I supposed
to protect him?

2211
02:15:56,956 --> 02:16:00,358
...are too secret for discussion,
candor is the only remedy.

2212
02:16:00,359 --> 02:16:04,297
Officials in Washington need to
start leveling with the American people.

2213
02:16:05,932 --> 02:16:08,733
That was the last straw
for Robert's enemies.

2214
02:16:08,734 --> 02:16:10,802
So he had to lose
his security clearance?

2215
02:16:10,803 --> 02:16:13,538
And with it, his credibility.

2216
02:16:13,539 --> 02:16:15,607
But how could they do it?

2217
02:16:15,608 --> 02:16:19,144
He was a war hero. He'd already
told everyone about his past.

2218
02:16:19,145 --> 02:16:21,179
Borden dredged it all up.

2219
02:16:21,180 --> 02:16:24,382
How could Borden get access
to Oppenheimer's FBI file?

2220
02:16:24,383 --> 02:16:28,486
Could it have been Nichols?
No, I can't imagine he'd do that.

2221
02:16:28,487 --> 02:16:30,355
But whoever did
unleashed a firestorm

2222
02:16:30,356 --> 02:16:35,394
that burned a path from the White
House back to my desk at the AEC.

2223
02:16:35,494 --> 02:16:37,229
You see him in there, right?

2224
02:16:37,997 --> 02:16:40,832
I've worked
my whole life to get here,

2225
02:16:40,833 --> 02:16:42,867
Cabinet of
the United States of America,

2226
02:16:42,868 --> 02:16:46,973
and now, in front of the entire country,
they're gonna put me back in my place.

2227
02:16:48,608 --> 02:16:50,875
A lowly shoe salesman.

2228
02:16:50,876 --> 02:16:53,044
Lewis, we can win this thing.

2229
02:16:53,045 --> 02:16:56,381
I-I think we can get the Senate
to grasp that you did your duty,

2230
02:16:56,382 --> 02:16:58,083
painful though it was.

2231
02:16:58,084 --> 02:17:00,385
Now, will Hill's testimony
back us up? Hill will be fine.

2232
02:17:00,386 --> 02:17:03,955
I don't really know him, but he
was one of Szilard's boys in Chicago,

2233
02:17:03,956 --> 02:17:05,457
and they never forgave Robert

2234
02:17:05,458 --> 02:17:08,127
for not supporting the petition
against bombing Japan.

2235
02:17:09,395 --> 02:17:13,365
This was taken
31 days after the bombing.

2236
02:17:13,366 --> 02:17:18,404
Virtually everyone in the
street for nearly a mile around

2237
02:17:18,604 --> 02:17:21,774
was instantly
and seriously burned.

2238
02:17:23,509 --> 02:17:27,779
The Japanese spoke of people
who wore striped clothing

2239
02:17:27,780 --> 02:17:30,750
upon whom the skin
was burned in stripes.

2240
02:17:31,651 --> 02:17:34,119
There were many
who thought themselves lucky,

2241
02:17:34,120 --> 02:17:38,290
who climbed out of the ruins of
their homes, only slightly injured.

2242
02:17:39,859 --> 02:17:41,993
But they died anyway.

2243
02:17:41,994 --> 02:17:46,564
They died days or weeks later
from the radium-like rays

2244
02:17:46,565 --> 02:17:50,936
emitted in great numbers
at the moment of the explosion.

2245
02:17:51,971 --> 02:17:54,072
Did you read
this crap in the papers?

2246
02:17:54,073 --> 02:17:56,141
A British physicist is saying

2247
02:17:56,142 --> 02:17:59,144
the atomic bombings were
not the last act of World War II,

2248
02:17:59,145 --> 02:18:02,314
but the first act
of this cold war with Russia.

2249
02:18:02,315 --> 02:18:03,715
Which physicist?

2250
02:18:03,716 --> 02:18:06,719
I think you knew him.
Patrick Blackett.

2251
02:18:09,355 --> 02:18:10,822
He may not be wrong.

2252
02:18:10,823 --> 02:18:12,257
Stimson is now telling me

2253
02:18:12,258 --> 02:18:15,660
we bombed an enemy
that was essentially defeated.

2254
02:18:15,661 --> 02:18:18,330
Robert, you've
all the influence now.

2255
02:18:19,165 --> 02:18:20,432
Please.

2256
02:18:20,433 --> 02:18:22,934
Urge them to continue
my research on the Super.

2257
02:18:22,935 --> 02:18:25,303
I neither can nor will, Edward.

2258
02:18:25,304 --> 02:18:26,671
Why not?

2259
02:18:26,672 --> 02:18:28,673
It's not the right use
of our resources.

2260
02:18:28,674 --> 02:18:30,208
Is that what you really believe?

2261
02:18:30,209 --> 02:18:35,214
J. Robert Oppenheimer.
Sphinx-like guru of the atom.

2262
02:18:36,449 --> 02:18:38,184
Nobody knows what you believe.

2263
02:18:39,318 --> 02:18:41,319
Do you? Hmm?

2264
02:18:41,320 --> 02:18:43,955
One final time,
our program director,

2265
02:18:43,956 --> 02:18:45,958
Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer.

2266
02:18:47,259 --> 02:18:49,461
I hope that, in years to come,

2267
02:18:49,462 --> 02:18:52,731
you will look back on your work
here with pride.

2268
02:18:52,732 --> 02:18:57,436
But today that pride must be
tempered with a profound concern.

2269
02:18:58,871 --> 02:19:03,308
If atomic weapons are to be added
to the arsenals of a warring world,

2270
02:19:03,309 --> 02:19:08,347
then the day will come when people
will curse the name of Los Alamos.

2271
02:19:12,752 --> 02:19:15,654
Sorry, Admiral.
Stopped off to get this.

2272
02:19:16,555 --> 02:19:19,124
It seems pretty favorable.

2273
02:19:19,125 --> 02:19:21,760
There's Oppenheimer.
What's the caption?

2274
02:19:21,761 --> 02:19:24,864
Uh, "J. Robert Oppenheimer,
Strauss fought...

2275
02:19:26,499 --> 02:19:27,933
and the US won."

2276
02:19:28,834 --> 02:19:30,101
That'll work.

2277
02:19:30,102 --> 02:19:32,437
Those were your words
from the other day.

2278
02:19:32,438 --> 02:19:34,105
We needed to pivot.

2279
02:19:34,106 --> 02:19:36,908
But how would you know what
Time magazine's gonna write?

2280
02:19:36,909 --> 02:19:39,211
Henry Luce is a friend.

2281
02:19:46,385 --> 02:19:49,320
You sat here and let
me tell you how it's done,

2282
02:19:49,321 --> 02:19:51,689
but you've been far ahead
all along.

2283
02:19:51,690 --> 02:19:54,859
Survival in Washington

2284
02:19:54,860 --> 02:19:57,296
is about knowing
how to get things done.

2285
02:19:57,663 --> 02:19:58,898
Right.

2286
02:20:00,766 --> 02:20:02,467
What was it you said
about Borden?

2287
02:20:02,468 --> 02:20:05,004
"Why get caught
holding the knife yourself?"

2288
02:20:06,672 --> 02:20:10,142
I'm beginning to think Borden
was holding the knife for you.

2289
02:20:12,144 --> 02:20:16,715
It's gonna come down to how much influence
Borden's been able to exert on Teller.

2290
02:20:17,917 --> 02:20:19,717
Did I say something funny?

2291
02:20:19,718 --> 02:20:23,888
Just "Borden, Borden, Borden"
when we all know that it's Strauss.

2292
02:20:23,889 --> 02:20:26,324
Lewis brought me
to Princeton, Kitty.

2293
02:20:26,325 --> 02:20:29,160
And then you humiliated him
in front of Congress.

2294
02:20:29,161 --> 02:20:32,031
But more useful than a sandwich.

2295
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:36,235
How'd I do?

2296
02:20:37,203 --> 02:20:39,070
Maybe a little too well, Robert.

2297
02:20:39,071 --> 02:20:40,572
That was six years ago.

2298
02:20:40,573 --> 02:20:44,275
You know the truly vindictive,
patient as saints.

2299
02:20:44,276 --> 02:20:47,078
Strauss has been perfectly clear
that he is neutral.

2300
02:20:47,079 --> 02:20:50,515
Wake up! It is Strauss!

2301
02:20:50,516 --> 02:20:53,751
It's always been Strauss,
and you know it.

2302
02:20:53,752 --> 02:20:55,521
Why won't you fight him?

2303
02:20:56,055 --> 02:20:57,289
Christ's sake.

2304
02:20:58,491 --> 02:21:02,360
It wasn't Nichols, or Hoover,
or one of Truman's guys.

2305
02:21:02,361 --> 02:21:04,929
It was you.
You gave the file to Borden.

2306
02:21:04,930 --> 02:21:07,232
You set him on Oppenheimer.
You convinced him to...

2307
02:21:07,233 --> 02:21:11,836
Borden didn't take
any convincing.

2308
02:21:11,837 --> 02:21:13,571
Take your time,
use the entire file.

2309
02:21:13,572 --> 02:21:15,907
Write up your conclusions,
send them to the FBI.

2310
02:21:15,908 --> 02:21:20,445
The material is obviously extensive,
but there's nothing new here.

2311
02:21:20,446 --> 02:21:22,780
Your conclusions will be.

2312
02:21:22,781 --> 02:21:24,883
And they'll have to be answered.

2313
02:21:24,884 --> 02:21:26,551
Hoover passes them to McCarthy?

2314
02:21:26,552 --> 02:21:29,921
Oppenheimer's too slippery
for that self-promoting clown.

2315
02:21:29,922 --> 02:21:33,024
I've talked it over with Hoover,
he'll hold McCarthy at bay

2316
02:21:33,025 --> 02:21:34,826
while you do this with the AEC.

2317
02:21:34,827 --> 02:21:35,994
A trial.

2318
02:21:35,995 --> 02:21:37,295
No. No trial.

2319
02:21:37,296 --> 02:21:40,164
You can't give Oppenheimer
a platform.

2320
02:21:40,165 --> 02:21:41,900
You can't martyr him.

2321
02:21:41,901 --> 02:21:45,370
We need a systematic destruction
of Oppenheimer's credibility

2322
02:21:45,371 --> 02:21:49,108
so he can never again speak
on matters of national security.

2323
02:21:49,708 --> 02:21:50,943
Then what?

2324
02:21:52,244 --> 02:21:55,714
A shabby little room,
far from the limelight.

2325
02:22:01,320 --> 02:22:03,388
A simple,
bureaucratic procedure.

2326
02:22:03,389 --> 02:22:05,924
His Q clearance
is up for renewal.

2327
02:22:05,925 --> 02:22:08,894
You send your accusations
to the FBI...

2328
02:22:10,696 --> 02:22:13,998
Hoover sends them to the AEC,
you're forced to act.

2329
02:22:13,999 --> 02:22:16,034
You write up an indictment.

2330
02:22:16,035 --> 02:22:20,271
You tell Oppenheimer his security
clearance is not being renewed.

2331
02:22:20,272 --> 02:22:22,307
But offer him
the chance to appeal.

2332
02:22:22,308 --> 02:22:24,809
As you can see, Robert,
it's not yet signed.

2333
02:22:24,810 --> 02:22:26,945
May I keep this?
No.

2334
02:22:26,946 --> 02:22:30,982
If you do decide to appeal,
they'll have to send you a copy.

2335
02:22:30,983 --> 02:22:34,752
When he appeals,
and trust me, he will,

2336
02:22:34,753 --> 02:22:36,821
I appoint a board.

2337
02:22:36,822 --> 02:22:39,457
They will, of course,
have counsel.

2338
02:22:39,458 --> 02:22:41,459
- Prosecutor?
- In all but name.

2339
02:22:41,460 --> 02:22:43,461
Who?
Roger Robb.

2340
02:22:43,462 --> 02:22:45,063
Ouch.

2341
02:22:45,064 --> 02:22:47,765
Robb will have security clearance
to examine Oppenheimer's file.

2342
02:22:47,766 --> 02:22:49,100
As will the Gray board.

2343
02:22:49,101 --> 02:22:50,569
Defense counsel will not.

2344
02:22:51,570 --> 02:22:53,137
A closed hearing.

2345
02:22:53,138 --> 02:22:57,241
"The so-called and derogatory
information in your indictment of me..."

2346
02:22:57,242 --> 02:23:01,146
No audience. No reporters.
No burden of proof.

2347
02:23:01,614 --> 02:23:03,215
No burden of proof?

2348
02:23:04,683 --> 02:23:06,051
We're not convicting.

2349
02:23:06,885 --> 02:23:08,620
We're just denying.

2350
02:23:14,226 --> 02:23:17,061
What is it you said?

2351
02:23:17,062 --> 02:23:20,599
"This is just how
the game is played."

2352
02:23:21,133 --> 02:23:23,434
Well, forgive my naivete.

2353
02:23:23,435 --> 02:23:27,439
Amateurs seek the sun...
get eaten.

2354
02:23:28,674 --> 02:23:31,542
Power stays in the shadows.

2355
02:23:31,543 --> 02:23:34,579
But, sir, you're out
of the shadows now.

2356
02:23:34,580 --> 02:23:36,814
Yeah, that's why
this has to work.

2357
02:23:36,815 --> 02:23:38,217
Well...

2358
02:23:39,551 --> 02:23:42,520
Teller's testifying
this morning. That'll help.

2359
02:23:42,521 --> 02:23:43,988
And then...

2360
02:23:43,989 --> 02:23:45,356
Hill is in the afternoon.

2361
02:23:45,357 --> 02:23:47,326
Hill is gonna help us too.

2362
02:23:49,962 --> 02:23:53,364
As you can see,
Robert, it's not yet signed.

2363
02:23:53,365 --> 02:23:55,367
- May I keep this?
- No.

2364
02:23:57,536 --> 02:24:02,541
If you do decide to appeal, then
they'll have to send you a copy.

2365
02:24:06,045 --> 02:24:08,347
Take my car and driver.
I insist.

2366
02:24:13,018 --> 02:24:15,019
I'll have to
consult my lawyers, Lewis.

2367
02:24:15,020 --> 02:24:17,855
Of course.
But don't take too long.

2368
02:24:17,856 --> 02:24:20,159
I can't keep Nichols at bay.

2369
02:24:26,131 --> 02:24:28,332
I'm sorry it's come
to this, Robert.

2370
02:24:28,333 --> 02:24:30,169
I think it's wrong.

2371
02:24:42,581 --> 02:24:46,384
Nichols wants me to fight so
he can get it all on the record.

2372
02:24:46,385 --> 02:24:48,319
Strauss wants me to walk away.

2373
02:24:48,320 --> 02:24:53,358
Strauss knows that you can't do
that. You'd be accepting the charges.

2374
02:24:53,759 --> 02:24:55,259
You'll lose your job.

2375
02:24:55,260 --> 02:24:58,229
You will lose your reputation.
We'll lose our house.

2376
02:24:58,230 --> 02:25:00,232
Robert, we have to fight.

2377
02:25:02,868 --> 02:25:06,871
As AEC counsel, I can't represent
you. I'll call Lloyd Garrison.

2378
02:25:06,872 --> 02:25:09,708
- He's good.
- The best, but...

2379
02:25:10,676 --> 02:25:12,010
I have to warn you,

2380
02:25:12,878 --> 02:25:15,379
this won't be a fair fight.

2381
02:25:15,380 --> 02:25:18,082
During your interview
with Boris Pash in 1943,

2382
02:25:18,083 --> 02:25:19,650
did you refer to microfilm?

2383
02:25:19,651 --> 02:25:22,854
- No.
- Tab 11, page one, paragraph three.

2384
02:25:22,855 --> 02:25:26,457
You never said, "Man of the
consulate expert in the use of microfilm."

2385
02:25:26,458 --> 02:25:28,092
- I'm sorry.
- No.

2386
02:25:28,093 --> 02:25:30,328
I would like to know what
document Mr. Robb is quoting from

2387
02:25:30,329 --> 02:25:31,796
and if we might
be furnished with a copy.

2388
02:25:31,797 --> 02:25:33,698
The document is classified,
Mr. Garrison.

2389
02:25:33,699 --> 02:25:36,100
I think we should get back
to firsthand information.

2390
02:25:36,101 --> 02:25:39,104
- This is firsthand.
- How so, Roger?

2391
02:25:40,639 --> 02:25:42,374
There was a recording
of the interview.

2392
02:25:46,779 --> 02:25:49,747
You let my client sit here
and potentially perjure himself

2393
02:25:49,748 --> 02:25:52,183
and all this time,
you had a recording?

2394
02:25:52,184 --> 02:25:55,153
Nobody told your client to
misrepresent his former answers.

2395
02:25:55,154 --> 02:25:57,321
Misrepres... It was 12 years ago.

2396
02:25:57,322 --> 02:25:58,723
Can we hear this recording?

2397
02:25:58,724 --> 02:26:00,591
You don't have the clearance,
Mr. Garrison.

2398
02:26:00,592 --> 02:26:03,060
- But you're reading it into the record.
- Please, please.

2399
02:26:03,061 --> 02:26:06,998
Is this proceeding interested
in entrapment or in truth?

2400
02:26:06,999 --> 02:26:10,935
If it's truth, where's the
disclosure? Where's the witness list?

2401
02:26:10,936 --> 02:26:13,771
Mr. Garrison, this isn't a
trial, as you're well aware.

2402
02:26:13,772 --> 02:26:18,176
Evidentiary rules do not apply.
We are dealing with national security.

2403
02:26:18,177 --> 02:26:19,844
Yes, sir, with all due respect,

2404
02:26:19,845 --> 02:26:22,780
I fail to see how national
security prevents the prosecution

2405
02:26:22,781 --> 02:26:24,348
from providing us
a list of witnesses.

2406
02:26:24,349 --> 02:26:26,117
Perhaps we are in need
of a brief recess.

2407
02:26:26,118 --> 02:26:27,919
Gentlemen, you have my words.

2408
02:26:27,920 --> 02:26:30,822
If you say they're from a
transcript, then I'll accept it.

2409
02:26:30,823 --> 02:26:33,658
I've already explained
I made up a cock-and-bull story.

2410
02:26:33,659 --> 02:26:36,994
But why would anyone
make up such an elaborate story?

2411
02:26:36,995 --> 02:26:38,630
Because I was an idiot.

2412
02:26:39,164 --> 02:26:41,032
Why lie?

2413
02:26:41,033 --> 02:26:44,702
Well, clearly with the intention of not
revealing who the intermediary was.

2414
02:26:44,703 --> 02:26:47,405
Your friend, Haakon Chevalier,
the communist?

2415
02:26:47,406 --> 02:26:48,874
Is he still your friend?

2416
02:26:49,842 --> 02:26:51,109
Yes.

2417
02:26:53,879 --> 02:26:56,214
Dr. Rabi,
thank you for coming.

2418
02:26:56,215 --> 02:26:58,115
Do you know who else
the prosecution has called?

2419
02:26:58,116 --> 02:27:00,452
Teller, obviously.

2420
02:27:01,320 --> 02:27:03,621
- They've asked Lawrence.
- What did he say?

2421
02:27:03,622 --> 02:27:06,924
- He wasn't going to help them, but...
- But?

2422
02:27:06,925 --> 02:27:11,963
Strauss told him that you and Ruth Tolman
have been having an affair for years.

2423
02:27:11,964 --> 02:27:14,532
The whole time
you lived with them in Pasadena.

2424
02:27:14,533 --> 02:27:18,102
He convinced Lawrence that
Richard died of a broken heart.

2425
02:27:18,103 --> 02:27:20,037
- That's absurd.
- What part?

2426
02:27:20,038 --> 02:27:21,772
The broken heart.

2427
02:27:21,773 --> 02:27:23,242
Richard never found out.

2428
02:27:24,309 --> 02:27:25,810
Is Lawrence gonna testify?

2429
02:27:25,811 --> 02:27:27,445
I don't know.

2430
02:27:27,446 --> 02:27:32,283
Dr. Rabi, what governmental
positions do you currently hold?

2431
02:27:32,284 --> 02:27:36,454
I am the chairman of the General
Advisory Committee to the AEC,

2432
02:27:36,455 --> 02:27:38,356
succeeding Dr. Oppenheimer.

2433
02:27:38,357 --> 02:27:40,726
And how long have you known
Dr. Oppenheimer?

2434
02:27:41,260 --> 02:27:43,494
Since 1928. I...

2435
02:27:43,495 --> 02:27:45,229
I know him quite well.

2436
02:27:45,230 --> 02:27:49,667
Well enough to speak to the
bearing of his loyalty and character?

2437
02:27:49,668 --> 02:27:53,704
Dr. Oppenheimer is a man
of upstanding character.

2438
02:27:53,705 --> 02:27:57,575
And he is loyal to the
United States, to his friends,

2439
02:27:57,576 --> 02:28:00,245
to the institutions
of which he is part.

2440
02:28:01,880 --> 02:28:03,315
Eat.

2441
02:28:21,900 --> 02:28:24,536
- What was that?
- Nothing to worry about.

2442
02:28:27,906 --> 02:28:29,607
After the Russian A-bomb test,

2443
02:28:29,608 --> 02:28:32,243
did Dr. Lawrence come to see you
about the hydrogen bomb?

2444
02:28:32,244 --> 02:28:33,978
You'd be better off asking him.

2445
02:28:33,979 --> 02:28:36,080
Well, I fully intend to.

2446
02:28:36,081 --> 02:28:40,284
Would you say that Dr. Oppenheimer
was unalterably opposed to the H-bomb?

2447
02:28:40,285 --> 02:28:43,154
No, he thought
that a fusion program

2448
02:28:43,155 --> 02:28:46,223
would come at the expense of
our awfully good fission program.

2449
02:28:46,224 --> 02:28:47,825
But that proved
not to be the case.

2450
02:28:47,826 --> 02:28:50,027
In the event,
both could be done.

2451
02:28:50,028 --> 02:28:52,830
Suppose that this board
did not feel satisfied that,

2452
02:28:52,831 --> 02:28:56,834
in his testimony here,
Dr. Oppenheimer had been wholly truthful.

2453
02:28:56,835 --> 02:28:59,236
What would you say whether
or not he should be cleared?

2454
02:28:59,237 --> 02:29:01,539
Why go through all this
against a man

2455
02:29:01,540 --> 02:29:03,841
who has accomplished
what Dr. Oppenheimer has?

2456
02:29:03,842 --> 02:29:05,343
Look at his record.

2457
02:29:05,344 --> 02:29:07,611
We have an A-bomb
and a whole series of it.

2458
02:29:07,612 --> 02:29:09,547
We have a whole series
of Super bombs.

2459
02:29:09,548 --> 02:29:12,416
What more do you want?
Mermaids?

2460
02:29:12,417 --> 02:29:16,153
But I've known Secretary
Strauss for many years,

2461
02:29:16,154 --> 02:29:19,790
and I feel it a necessity
to express the warm support

2462
02:29:19,791 --> 02:29:22,193
for science and scientists
Lewis has shown.

2463
02:29:22,194 --> 02:29:25,162
We'll break now, unless
there's any immediate business.

2464
02:29:25,163 --> 02:29:28,065
Senator, I'd like to
once again request

2465
02:29:28,066 --> 02:29:31,102
that we're furnished
with a list of witnesses.

2466
02:29:31,103 --> 02:29:32,737
And I will remind the nominee

2467
02:29:32,738 --> 02:29:35,506
that we don't always have
that information in advance.

2468
02:29:35,507 --> 02:29:38,642
We do know that Dr. Hill
will be here after lunch.

2469
02:29:38,643 --> 02:29:41,512
Mr. Chairman, our next
scheduled witness, Dr. Lawrence,

2470
02:29:41,513 --> 02:29:44,616
has apparently
come down with colitis.

2471
02:29:47,653 --> 02:29:49,721
So we'll proceed
with William Borden instead.

2472
02:29:50,922 --> 02:29:53,592
Mr. Borden, welcome.
Please take a seat.

2473
02:29:54,993 --> 02:29:59,797
Mr. Borden, during your
investigation into Dr. Oppenheimer,

2474
02:29:59,798 --> 02:30:02,833
- did you reach certain conclusions?
- I did.

2475
02:30:02,834 --> 02:30:05,369
And did there come a time when
you expressed those conclusions

2476
02:30:05,370 --> 02:30:08,973
in a letter to Mr. J. Edgar Hoover of
the Federal Bureau of Investigation?

2477
02:30:08,974 --> 02:30:11,275
- That is correct.
- Prior to the writing of the letter,

2478
02:30:11,276 --> 02:30:13,778
did you discuss the writing of
the letter with anybody attached

2479
02:30:13,779 --> 02:30:15,579
to the Atomic Energy Commission?

2480
02:30:15,580 --> 02:30:17,982
- I did not.
- Do you have a copy of the letter?

2481
02:30:17,983 --> 02:30:19,183
I have one in front of me.

2482
02:30:19,184 --> 02:30:21,852
Would you please be so kind
as to read it, sir?

2483
02:30:21,853 --> 02:30:24,789
"Dear Mr. Hoover, the
purpose of this letter is to state..."

2484
02:30:24,790 --> 02:30:27,491
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
if I could have a...

2485
02:30:27,492 --> 02:30:30,961
What is the purpose of the delay?
He's simply gonna read the letter.

2486
02:30:30,962 --> 02:30:34,432
Mr. Chairman, this is the
first I've seen of this letter,

2487
02:30:34,433 --> 02:30:37,034
and I see statements here,
at least one,

2488
02:30:37,035 --> 02:30:39,937
of a kind that I don't think anyone
would like to see go into the record.

2489
02:30:39,938 --> 02:30:42,673
These are accusations that
have not previously been made.

2490
02:30:42,674 --> 02:30:44,642
That are not part of
the indictment from Nichols.

2491
02:30:44,643 --> 02:30:46,977
Accusations of a kind
that I don't think belong here.

2492
02:30:46,978 --> 02:30:49,113
The witness wrote this letter
on his own initiative,

2493
02:30:49,114 --> 02:30:51,615
laying out evidence that has
already been before the board.

2494
02:30:51,616 --> 02:30:53,350
His conclusions
are valid testimony,

2495
02:30:53,351 --> 02:30:56,887
just like the positive conclusions
of friends of Dr. Oppenheimer.

2496
02:30:56,888 --> 02:30:58,255
It cuts both ways.

2497
02:30:58,256 --> 02:31:00,458
How long has counsel been
in possession of this letter?

2498
02:31:00,459 --> 02:31:04,361
I don't think I should be subject to
cross-examination by you, Mr. Garrison.

2499
02:31:04,362 --> 02:31:07,698
Mr. Garrison, given that we on
the board have all read the letter,

2500
02:31:07,699 --> 02:31:10,234
wouldn't it be better
to have it in the record?

2501
02:31:10,235 --> 02:31:11,937
Let's proceed.

2502
02:31:13,638 --> 02:31:15,172
"Dear Mr. Hoover,

2503
02:31:15,173 --> 02:31:18,275
the purpose of this letter
is to state my opinion

2504
02:31:18,276 --> 02:31:22,680
based upon years of study of
the available classified evidence,

2505
02:31:22,681 --> 02:31:24,748
that more probably than not

2506
02:31:24,749 --> 02:31:29,687
J. Robert Oppenheimer
is an agent of the Soviet Union.

2507
02:31:29,688 --> 02:31:32,089
The following conclusions
are justified.

2508
02:31:32,090 --> 02:31:36,427
One, between 1929 and 1942,
more probably than not,

2509
02:31:36,428 --> 02:31:40,564
J. Robert Oppenheimer was a
sufficiently hardened communist,

2510
02:31:40,565 --> 02:31:43,134
that he volunteered information
to the Soviets.

2511
02:31:43,135 --> 02:31:45,269
Two, more probably than not,

2512
02:31:45,270 --> 02:31:49,707
he has since been functioning
as an espionage agent.

2513
02:31:49,708 --> 02:31:52,176
Three, more probably than not,

2514
02:31:52,177 --> 02:31:54,912
he has since acted
under a Soviet directive

2515
02:31:54,913 --> 02:31:57,815
in influencing United States
military policy..."

2516
02:31:57,816 --> 02:32:00,084
I'm sorry, Robert.
..."atomic energy, intelligence..."

2517
02:32:00,085 --> 02:32:05,055
Is anyone ever going to tell the
truth about what's happening here?

2518
02:32:05,056 --> 02:32:08,193
We will now hear
from Dr. David Hill.

2519
02:32:18,203 --> 02:32:21,640
Dr. Hill, would you care
to make a statement?

2520
02:32:23,308 --> 02:32:24,708
Thank you.

2521
02:32:24,709 --> 02:32:28,312
I've been asked to testify
about Lewis Strauss.

2522
02:32:28,313 --> 02:32:33,351
A man who has given years of
service in high positions of government

2523
02:32:33,819 --> 02:32:38,823
and who is known to be earnest,
hardworking and intelligent.

2524
02:32:39,758 --> 02:32:42,193
The views I have to express
are my own,

2525
02:32:42,194 --> 02:32:45,062
but I believe that much I
have to say will help to indicate

2526
02:32:45,063 --> 02:32:48,499
why most of the scientists
in this country

2527
02:32:48,500 --> 02:32:53,538
would prefer to see Mr. Strauss
completely out of government.

2528
02:32:55,473 --> 02:32:59,476
You're referring to the
hostility of certain scientists

2529
02:32:59,477 --> 02:33:03,514
directed toward Mr. Strauss
because of his commitment to security,

2530
02:33:03,515 --> 02:33:06,551
as demonstrated
in the Oppenheimer affair?

2531
02:33:08,887 --> 02:33:10,621
No.

2532
02:33:10,622 --> 02:33:15,193
Because of the personal vindictiveness
he demonstrated against Dr. Oppenheimer.

2533
02:33:16,728 --> 02:33:18,896
Order.

2534
02:33:18,897 --> 02:33:20,631
Order.

2535
02:33:20,632 --> 02:33:24,202
It appears to most scientists
around this country

2536
02:33:25,237 --> 02:33:28,138
that Robert Oppenheimer
is now being pilloried

2537
02:33:28,139 --> 02:33:32,543
and put through an ordeal because
he expressed his honest opinions.

2538
02:33:32,544 --> 02:33:35,879
Dr. Bush, I thought I was
performing a service to my country

2539
02:33:35,880 --> 02:33:37,414
when hearing this case.

2540
02:33:37,415 --> 02:33:41,819
No board in this country
should sit in judgment of a man

2541
02:33:41,820 --> 02:33:43,954
because he expressed
strong opinions.

2542
02:33:43,955 --> 02:33:47,091
If you wanna try that case,
you should try me.

2543
02:33:47,092 --> 02:33:50,694
Excuse me, gentlemen,
if I become stirred.

2544
02:33:50,695 --> 02:33:52,630
But I am.

2545
02:33:52,631 --> 02:33:56,800
Dr. Hill, we've already heard that
Mr. Strauss did not bring the charges,

2546
02:33:56,801 --> 02:33:59,837
or participate in the hearings
against Dr. Oppenheimer.

2547
02:33:59,838 --> 02:34:04,642
The Oppenheimer matter
was initiated and carried through

2548
02:34:04,643 --> 02:34:07,279
largely through the animus
of Lewis Strauss.

2549
02:34:08,813 --> 02:34:11,615
Oppenheimer made mincemeat
out of Strauss's position

2550
02:34:11,616 --> 02:34:13,517
on the shipment of isotopes
to Norway,

2551
02:34:13,518 --> 02:34:16,987
and Strauss never forgave him
this public humiliation.

2552
02:34:16,988 --> 02:34:21,125
Another controversy between them centered
around their differences in judgment

2553
02:34:21,126 --> 02:34:24,261
on how the H-bomb would
contribute to national security.

2554
02:34:24,262 --> 02:34:26,897
Strauss turned
to the personnel security system

2555
02:34:26,898 --> 02:34:30,434
in order to destroy
Oppenheimer's effectiveness.

2556
02:34:30,435 --> 02:34:33,404
And Strauss was able
to find a few ambitious men

2557
02:34:33,405 --> 02:34:36,273
who also disagreed
with Oppenheimer's positions

2558
02:34:36,274 --> 02:34:39,643
and envied him his prestige
in government circles.

2559
02:34:39,644 --> 02:34:44,182
I've always assumed, and still assume,
that he's loyal to the United States.

2560
02:34:44,582 --> 02:34:46,417
I believe this.

2561
02:34:46,418 --> 02:34:48,886
And I shall believe it until I see
very conclusive proof to the opposite.

2562
02:34:48,887 --> 02:34:53,124
Do you, or do you not, believe that
Dr. Oppenheimer is a security risk?

2563
02:34:56,795 --> 02:34:58,329
In a great number of cases,

2564
02:34:58,330 --> 02:35:01,598
I have seen Dr. Oppenheimer
act in a way which was, to me,

2565
02:35:01,599 --> 02:35:03,400
exceedingly hard to understand.

2566
02:35:03,401 --> 02:35:06,136
I thoroughly disagreed with him
in numerous issues,

2567
02:35:06,137 --> 02:35:09,740
and his actions, frankly, appeared
to me confused and complicated.

2568
02:35:09,741 --> 02:35:11,375
To this extent, I feel,

2569
02:35:11,376 --> 02:35:14,611
I want to see the vital
interests of this country

2570
02:35:14,612 --> 02:35:16,747
in hands
which I understand better,

2571
02:35:16,748 --> 02:35:18,883
and therefore trust more.

2572
02:35:19,651 --> 02:35:21,352
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Thank you.

2573
02:35:25,123 --> 02:35:26,224
I'm sorry.

2574
02:35:28,293 --> 02:35:31,262
You shook his fucking hand?

2575
02:35:31,997 --> 02:35:33,964
Oh, I would have
spit in his face.

2576
02:35:33,965 --> 02:35:35,966
Not sure the board
would have appreciated that.

2577
02:35:35,967 --> 02:35:37,935
Is it not gentlemanly enough
for you?

2578
02:35:37,936 --> 02:35:40,671
I think you're all being
too goddamn gentlemanly.

2579
02:35:40,672 --> 02:35:42,673
Gray must see
what Robb is doing.

2580
02:35:42,674 --> 02:35:44,608
Why doesn't he just
shut him down?

2581
02:35:44,609 --> 02:35:47,144
And you shaking Teller's hand.

2582
02:35:47,145 --> 02:35:50,814
You need to stop
playing the martyr.

2583
02:35:50,815 --> 02:35:55,853
Under the current AEC guidelines,
would you clear Dr. Oppenheimer today?

2584
02:36:02,027 --> 02:36:06,497
Under my interpretation
of the Atomic Energy Act,

2585
02:36:06,498 --> 02:36:11,436
which did not exist when I
hired Dr. Oppenheimer in 1942,

2586
02:36:12,437 --> 02:36:17,442
I would not clear him today
if I were on the commission.

2587
02:36:18,109 --> 02:36:19,643
Good, thank you,
General, that is all.

2588
02:36:19,644 --> 02:36:22,446
But I don't think
I'd clear any of those guys.

2589
02:36:22,447 --> 02:36:23,715
That's all.

2590
02:36:26,351 --> 02:36:28,485
Dr. Oppenheimer
had no responsibility

2591
02:36:28,486 --> 02:36:31,355
in the selection or the
clearance of Klaus Fuchs, did he?

2592
02:36:31,356 --> 02:36:32,523
No. None at all.

2593
02:36:32,524 --> 02:36:34,358
And you wouldn't want to
leave this board

2594
02:36:34,359 --> 02:36:36,026
with any suggestion today

2595
02:36:36,027 --> 02:36:38,996
that you're here questioning his
basic loyalty to the United States

2596
02:36:38,997 --> 02:36:40,664
and the operation of Los Alamos.

2597
02:36:40,665 --> 02:36:42,466
By no means.

2598
02:36:42,467 --> 02:36:45,303
I hope I didn't lead anyone to
believe otherwise for an instant.

2599
02:36:46,404 --> 02:36:47,806
Thank you, General.

2600
02:37:04,989 --> 02:37:07,324
Okay. We shouldn't
keep them waiting.

2601
02:37:07,325 --> 02:37:08,725
She'll be here.

2602
02:37:08,726 --> 02:37:10,694
Do you even want her here?

2603
02:37:10,695 --> 02:37:12,429
Only a fool or an adolescent

2604
02:37:12,430 --> 02:37:14,731
presumes to know
someone else's relationship,

2605
02:37:14,732 --> 02:37:16,734
and you're neither, Lloyd.

2606
02:37:19,270 --> 02:37:22,273
Kitty and I, we're grown-ups.

2607
02:37:23,141 --> 02:37:25,442
We've walked through fire together.

2608
02:37:25,443 --> 02:37:27,778
She'll do fine.

2609
02:37:27,779 --> 02:37:32,182
Would you describe your views
on communism as pro, anti, neutral?

2610
02:37:32,183 --> 02:37:33,851
Very strongly against.

2611
02:37:33,852 --> 02:37:38,223
I've had nothing to do with
communism since 1936, since...

2612
02:37:39,090 --> 02:37:41,192
since before I met Robert.

2613
02:37:42,694 --> 02:37:44,928
That's all.

2614
02:37:44,929 --> 02:37:46,763
The record demonstrates
that Oppenheimer

2615
02:37:46,764 --> 02:37:50,033
was not interrogated by
impartial and disinterested counsel

2616
02:37:50,034 --> 02:37:51,368
for the Gray board.

2617
02:37:51,369 --> 02:37:53,504
He was interrogated
by a prosecutor

2618
02:37:53,505 --> 02:37:55,672
who used all the tricks of a
rather ingenious legal background.

2619
02:37:55,673 --> 02:38:00,411
You are charging now that the
Gray board permitted a prosecution.

2620
02:38:01,012 --> 02:38:02,880
If I were on the Gray board,

2621
02:38:02,881 --> 02:38:06,617
I would have protested against the
tactics of the man who served, in fact,

2622
02:38:06,618 --> 02:38:08,051
as the prosecuting counsel.

2623
02:38:08,052 --> 02:38:10,188
A man appointed,
not by the board,

2624
02:38:11,189 --> 02:38:13,491
but by Lewis Strauss.

2625
02:38:15,426 --> 02:38:16,427
Who was this?

2626
02:38:17,896 --> 02:38:19,663
I'm sorry?

2627
02:38:19,664 --> 02:38:20,864
Who was this?

2628
02:38:20,865 --> 02:38:22,333
Uh, Roger Robb.

2629
02:38:22,834 --> 02:38:24,335
Mrs. Oppenheimer.

2630
02:38:28,506 --> 02:38:31,075
Did you have a Communist
Party membership card?

2631
02:38:32,710 --> 02:38:33,877
I'm...

2632
02:38:33,878 --> 02:38:34,945
I'm not sure.

2633
02:38:34,946 --> 02:38:36,381
Not sure?

2634
02:38:38,917 --> 02:38:40,251
Well...

2635
02:38:43,254 --> 02:38:44,289
Well?

2636
02:38:53,264 --> 02:38:56,300
I mean, presumably,
the act of joining the Party

2637
02:38:56,301 --> 02:38:59,938
required sending some money
and receiving a card, no?

2638
02:39:02,674 --> 02:39:03,908
Yeah.

2639
02:39:09,714 --> 02:39:11,082
Sorry.

2640
02:39:11,883 --> 02:39:13,384
Yeah.

2641
02:39:15,019 --> 02:39:18,488
It's just it was all so very
long ago, Mr. Robb, wasn't it?

2642
02:39:18,489 --> 02:39:20,257
- Not really.
- Long enough to have forgotten.

2643
02:39:20,258 --> 02:39:21,625
Did you return the card
or rip it up?

2644
02:39:21,626 --> 02:39:23,694
The card whose existence
I've forgotten?

2645
02:39:23,695 --> 02:39:26,864
- Your Communist Party membership card.
- Haven't the slightest idea.

2646
02:39:29,100 --> 02:39:33,670
Can a distinction be made between
Soviet communism and communism?

2647
02:39:33,671 --> 02:39:36,840
In the days when I was a member, I
thought they were definitely two things.

2648
02:39:36,841 --> 02:39:40,143
I thought that the Communist
Party of the United States

2649
02:39:40,144 --> 02:39:42,779
was concerned with
our domestic problems.

2650
02:39:42,780 --> 02:39:44,648
I now no longer believe this.

2651
02:39:44,649 --> 02:39:46,550
I believe the thing's linked together
and spread all over the world,

2652
02:39:46,551 --> 02:39:50,287
and I have believed this since
I left the Party, 16 years ago.

2653
02:39:50,288 --> 02:39:53,624
- But...
- 17 years ago. My mistake.

2654
02:39:53,625 --> 02:39:55,159
- But you sai...
- Sorry, 18.

2655
02:39:56,461 --> 02:39:58,662
18 years ago.

2656
02:39:58,663 --> 02:40:01,898
Are you familiar with the fact your
husband was making contributions

2657
02:40:01,899 --> 02:40:04,034
to the Spanish Civil War
as late as 1942?

2658
02:40:04,035 --> 02:40:06,336
I knew that Robert
gave money from time to time.

2659
02:40:06,337 --> 02:40:08,972
Did you know this money was
going into Communist Party channels?

2660
02:40:08,973 --> 02:40:10,874
- Don't you mean "through"?
- Pardon?

2661
02:40:10,875 --> 02:40:13,744
I think you mean "through
Communist Party channels," don't you?

2662
02:40:13,745 --> 02:40:15,479
Yes!
Yes?

2663
02:40:15,480 --> 02:40:17,381
- Yes!
- Yes.

2664
02:40:17,382 --> 02:40:20,250
Then would it be fair to say
that this meant that by 1942,

2665
02:40:20,251 --> 02:40:24,421
your husband had not stopped having
anything to do with the Communist Party?

2666
02:40:24,422 --> 02:40:26,089
You don't have
to answer that yes or no.

2667
02:40:26,090 --> 02:40:27,691
You can answer that
any way you wish.

2668
02:40:27,692 --> 02:40:29,326
I know that, thank you.

2669
02:40:29,327 --> 02:40:31,194
It's your question.

2670
02:40:31,195 --> 02:40:32,696
It's not properly phrased.

2671
02:40:32,697 --> 02:40:34,431
- Do you understand what I'm getting at?
- I do.

2672
02:40:34,432 --> 02:40:35,999
Then why don't you
answer it that way?

2673
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:37,434
'Cause I don't like your phrase.

2674
02:40:37,435 --> 02:40:39,503
"Having anything to do
with the Communist Party."

2675
02:40:39,504 --> 02:40:42,572
Because Robert never had anything
to do with the Communist Party as such.

2676
02:40:42,573 --> 02:40:44,908
I know he gave money
to Spanish refugees.

2677
02:40:44,909 --> 02:40:48,311
I know he took an intellectual
interest in communist ideas...

2678
02:40:48,312 --> 02:40:49,980
Are there two types
of communists?

2679
02:40:49,981 --> 02:40:53,017
Intellectual communists and
your plain, old, regular commie?

2680
02:40:54,252 --> 02:40:55,952
Well, I couldn't
answer that one.

2681
02:40:55,953 --> 02:40:58,656
I couldn't either.

2682
02:41:05,563 --> 02:41:06,596
Good evening.

2683
02:41:06,597 --> 02:41:08,331
Robert,
you can't win this thing.

2684
02:41:08,332 --> 02:41:10,434
It's a kangaroo court
with a predetermined outcome.

2685
02:41:10,435 --> 02:41:14,639
Why put yourself through
more of it? I have my reasons.

2686
02:41:16,007 --> 02:41:17,174
All right.

2687
02:41:17,175 --> 02:41:18,609
Good night.

2688
02:41:23,147 --> 02:41:24,615
He has a point.

2689
02:41:25,616 --> 02:41:27,718
I'm not sure you understand, Albert.

2690
02:41:27,719 --> 02:41:28,885
No?

2691
02:41:28,886 --> 02:41:32,190
I left my country
never to return.

2692
02:41:32,924 --> 02:41:34,825
You served your country well.

2693
02:41:34,826 --> 02:41:38,695
If this is the reward
she offers you, then...

2694
02:41:38,696 --> 02:41:41,432
perhaps you should
turn your back on her.

2695
02:41:42,233 --> 02:41:45,102
Damn it, I happen
to love this country.

2696
02:41:45,103 --> 02:41:47,370
Then tell them to go to hell.

2697
02:41:47,371 --> 02:41:49,005
Interestingly enough,

2698
02:41:49,006 --> 02:41:51,408
this is no longer
a confirmation hearing,

2699
02:41:51,409 --> 02:41:54,512
it's now a trial about a trial!

2700
02:41:55,913 --> 02:41:59,082
It's not good he's telling
everyone you initiated the hearings.

2701
02:41:59,083 --> 02:42:00,984
He can't prove a goddamn thing.

2702
02:42:00,985 --> 02:42:04,654
He certainly can't prove
that I gave the file to Borden.

2703
02:42:04,655 --> 02:42:07,958
We're not in court, sir.
There's no burden of proof.

2704
02:42:07,959 --> 02:42:09,794
Right.
They're not convicting...

2705
02:42:10,695 --> 02:42:12,229
just denying.

2706
02:42:12,230 --> 02:42:15,398
But why would Hill come here to
tear me down? What's his angle?

2707
02:42:15,399 --> 02:42:18,502
Do people need a reason
to do the right thing?

2708
02:42:18,503 --> 02:42:19,903
As he sees it.

2709
02:42:19,904 --> 02:42:22,806
I told you, Oppenheimer poisoned
the scientists against me,

2710
02:42:22,807 --> 02:42:24,341
right from that first meeting.

2711
02:42:24,342 --> 02:42:27,244
I don't know what Oppenheimer
said to him that day,

2712
02:42:27,245 --> 02:42:30,214
but Einstein
wouldn't even meet my eye.

2713
02:42:31,783 --> 02:42:34,484
Oppenheimer knows
how to manipulate his own.

2714
02:42:34,485 --> 02:42:38,021
And at Los Alamos, he preyed
on the naivete of scientists

2715
02:42:38,022 --> 02:42:40,557
who thought they'd get a say
in how we used their work.

2716
02:42:40,558 --> 02:42:43,260
Don't ever think
he was that naive himself.

2717
02:42:43,261 --> 02:42:45,195
Doctor.

2718
02:42:45,196 --> 02:42:50,201
During your work on the hydrogen bomb,
were you deterred by any moral qualms?

2719
02:42:50,835 --> 02:42:52,335
Yes, of course.

2720
02:42:52,336 --> 02:42:54,371
But you still got on with
your work, didn't you?

2721
02:42:54,372 --> 02:42:58,175
Yes, because this was work of exploration.
It was not the preparation of a weapon.

2722
02:42:58,176 --> 02:43:00,110
You mean it was more of
an academic excursion?

2723
02:43:00,111 --> 02:43:03,313
No, it is not an academic thing
whether you can build a hydrogen bomb.

2724
02:43:03,314 --> 02:43:04,614
It's a matter of life and death.

2725
02:43:04,615 --> 02:43:06,449
By 1942,
you were actively pushing

2726
02:43:06,450 --> 02:43:08,318
the development of the
hydrogen bomb, weren't you?

2727
02:43:08,319 --> 02:43:11,521
Pushing's not the right word.
Supporting it and working on it, yes.

2728
02:43:11,522 --> 02:43:13,890
So when did these moral qualms
become so strong

2729
02:43:13,891 --> 02:43:16,960
that you actively opposed the
development of the hydrogen bomb?

2730
02:43:16,961 --> 02:43:19,830
When it was suggested that it
be the policy of the United States

2731
02:43:19,831 --> 02:43:22,766
to make these things at all
cost, without regard to the balance

2732
02:43:22,767 --> 02:43:26,637
between these weapons and
atomic weapons as part of our arsenal.

2733
02:43:27,772 --> 02:43:29,873
What do moral qualms
have to do with that?

2734
02:43:29,874 --> 02:43:33,510
What do moral qualms
have to do with it? Yes.

2735
02:43:33,511 --> 02:43:35,645
Oppenheimer wanted to own
the atomic bomb.

2736
02:43:35,646 --> 02:43:37,681
He wanted to be the man
who moved the Earth.

2737
02:43:37,682 --> 02:43:42,118
He talks about putting the
nuclear genie back in the bottle.

2738
02:43:42,119 --> 02:43:45,789
Well, I'm here to tell you that I
know J. Robert Oppenheimer,

2739
02:43:45,790 --> 02:43:49,025
and if he could do it all over,
he'd do it all the same.

2740
02:43:49,026 --> 02:43:53,063
You know he's never once said
that he regrets Hiroshima?

2741
02:43:53,064 --> 02:43:55,732
He'd do it all over. Why?

2742
02:43:55,733 --> 02:43:59,636
Because it made him the most
important man who ever lived.

2743
02:43:59,637 --> 02:44:03,506
Well, we've freely used
the atomic bomb...

2744
02:44:03,507 --> 02:44:05,609
In fact, Doctor, you assisted
in selecting the target

2745
02:44:05,610 --> 02:44:07,811
to drop the atomic bomb
on Japan, didn't you?

2746
02:44:07,812 --> 02:44:09,746
- Yes.
- Then you knew, did you not,

2747
02:44:09,747 --> 02:44:12,048
that by dropping that atomic
bomb on the target you selected,

2748
02:44:12,049 --> 02:44:15,051
that thousands of civilians would
be killed or injured, is that correct?

2749
02:44:15,052 --> 02:44:17,454
Yes, not as many as turned out...

2750
02:44:17,455 --> 02:44:20,123
Oh. Well, how many
were killed or injured?

2751
02:44:20,124 --> 02:44:21,258
70,000.

2752
02:44:21,259 --> 02:44:22,826
70,000 at both Hiroshima and...

2753
02:44:22,827 --> 02:44:24,494
110,000 at both.

2754
02:44:24,495 --> 02:44:26,430
On the day of each bombing?

2755
02:44:27,632 --> 02:44:29,866
- Yes.
- And in the weeks and years that followed?

2756
02:44:29,867 --> 02:44:33,336
It has been put at somewhere
between 50,000 and 100,000.

2757
02:44:33,337 --> 02:44:35,472
- 220,000 dead, at least.
- Yes.

2758
02:44:35,473 --> 02:44:37,375
Any moral scruples about that?

2759
02:44:38,943 --> 02:44:40,844
Terrible ones.

2760
02:44:40,845 --> 02:44:43,813
Yet you testified in here that the
bombing of Hiroshima was very successful.

2761
02:44:43,814 --> 02:44:46,917
- Technically successful.
- Oh! Technically, it was very successful.

2762
02:44:46,918 --> 02:44:49,286
And it is also alleged
to have helped end the war.

2763
02:44:49,287 --> 02:44:52,622
Would you have been supportive of the
dropping of a hydrogen bomb on Hiroshima?

2764
02:44:52,623 --> 02:44:55,191
- That would make no sense at all.
- Why?

2765
02:44:55,192 --> 02:44:56,927
The target is too small.

2766
02:44:56,928 --> 02:44:59,596
Well, supposing there had been
a target in Japan big enough

2767
02:44:59,597 --> 02:45:01,031
for a thermonuclear weapon,

2768
02:45:01,032 --> 02:45:02,699
would you have been opposed
to the dropping of it?

2769
02:45:02,700 --> 02:45:04,501
This was not a problem
with which I was confronted...

2770
02:45:04,502 --> 02:45:06,136
I'm confronting you
with it now, sir.

2771
02:45:06,137 --> 02:45:07,837
It was all part of his plan.

2772
02:45:07,838 --> 02:45:11,675
He wanted the glorious,
insincere guilt of the self-important

2773
02:45:11,676 --> 02:45:13,543
to wear like a fucking crown.

2774
02:45:13,544 --> 02:45:18,582
Say, "No, we cannot go down this
road," even as he knew we'd have to.

2775
02:45:19,216 --> 02:45:21,251
Would you have been
opposed to the dropping...

2776
02:45:21,252 --> 02:45:23,520
...of a thermonuclear weapon on
Japan because of moral scruples?

2777
02:45:23,521 --> 02:45:25,088
Yes, I believe I would, sir.

2778
02:45:25,089 --> 02:45:26,623
Did you oppose the dropping

2779
02:45:26,624 --> 02:45:28,792
of an atomic bomb on Hiroshima
because of moral scruples?

2780
02:45:28,793 --> 02:45:30,794
- We set forth our arg...
- No, you.

2781
02:45:30,795 --> 02:45:32,629
- I'm asking you. You!
- I set...

2782
02:45:32,630 --> 02:45:34,931
I set forth our arguments
against dropping it,

2783
02:45:34,932 --> 02:45:36,967
but I did not endorse them.

2784
02:45:36,968 --> 02:45:39,936
You mean after working night and
day for three years building the bomb,

2785
02:45:39,937 --> 02:45:41,972
you then argued
against the use of it.

2786
02:45:41,973 --> 02:45:45,809
I was asked by the secretary of
war what the views of scientists were.

2787
02:45:45,810 --> 02:45:48,044
I gave him the views against
and the views for.

2788
02:45:48,045 --> 02:45:50,647
You supported the dropping
of the atom bomb on Japan.

2789
02:45:50,648 --> 02:45:53,116
- What do you mean, "support"?
- You supported it.

2790
02:45:53,117 --> 02:45:55,752
- You helped pick the target, didn't you?
- I did my job.

2791
02:45:55,753 --> 02:45:58,321
I was not in a policy-making
position at Los Alamos.

2792
02:45:58,322 --> 02:46:00,156
I would have done anything
I was asked to do.

2793
02:46:00,157 --> 02:46:02,759
Then you would have built
the H-bomb too, wouldn't you?

2794
02:46:02,760 --> 02:46:05,061
- I couldn't.
- I didn't ask you that, Doctor.

2795
02:46:05,062 --> 02:46:06,529
And the GAC report,

2796
02:46:06,530 --> 02:46:08,932
which you co-authored
after the Soviet atomic test,

2797
02:46:08,933 --> 02:46:12,569
said a Super bomb
should never be built.

2798
02:46:12,570 --> 02:46:13,937
What we meant...
What I meant was...

2799
02:46:13,938 --> 02:46:16,073
- What you? Who? Who?
- What I meant...

2800
02:46:17,575 --> 02:46:20,710
And wouldn't the Russians do
anything to increase their strength?

2801
02:46:20,711 --> 02:46:23,213
If we did it,
they would have to do it.

2802
02:46:23,214 --> 02:46:27,684
Our efforts would only fuel their efforts,
just as it had with the atomic bomb.

2803
02:46:27,685 --> 02:46:31,454
"Just as it had
with the atomic bomb," exactly!

2804
02:46:31,455 --> 02:46:35,926
No moral scruples in 1945,
plenty in 1949.

2805
02:46:40,131 --> 02:46:41,866
Dr. Oppenheimer...

2806
02:46:43,434 --> 02:46:46,269
when did your strong
moral convictions develop

2807
02:46:46,270 --> 02:46:48,472
with respect to
the hydrogen bomb?

2808
02:46:55,813 --> 02:46:57,915
When it became clear to me...

2809
02:46:59,050 --> 02:47:02,520
that we would tend
to use any weapon we had.

2810
02:47:05,122 --> 02:47:07,524
J. Robert Oppenheimer
the Martyr.

2811
02:47:07,525 --> 02:47:10,026
I gave him
exactly what he wanted.

2812
02:47:10,027 --> 02:47:14,598
To be remembered for Trinity,
not Hiroshima.

2813
02:47:15,166 --> 02:47:17,501
Not Nagasaki.

2814
02:47:20,237 --> 02:47:22,072
He should be thanking me.

2815
02:47:23,074 --> 02:47:24,542
Well, he's not.

2816
02:47:27,645 --> 02:47:29,012
Do we still have enough votes,

2817
02:47:29,013 --> 02:47:31,014
or is the crowning moment
of my career

2818
02:47:31,015 --> 02:47:35,018
about to become the most
public humiliation of my life?

2819
02:47:35,019 --> 02:47:38,788
Full Senate's about to vote.
You'll scrape through.

2820
02:47:38,789 --> 02:47:40,523
Great, then gather
the fucking press.

2821
02:47:40,524 --> 02:47:42,492
Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer.

2822
02:47:42,493 --> 02:47:45,562
This board, having heard
testimony from you

2823
02:47:45,563 --> 02:47:48,598
and many of your current
and former colleagues,

2824
02:47:48,599 --> 02:47:53,137
has come to the unanimous
conclusion that you are a loyal citizen.

2825
02:47:55,106 --> 02:48:00,111
However, in the light
of your continuing associations

2826
02:48:00,344 --> 02:48:03,947
and disregard for the security
apparatus of this country,

2827
02:48:03,948 --> 02:48:07,584
together with your
somewhat disturbing conduct

2828
02:48:07,585 --> 02:48:09,586
on the hydrogen bomb program,

2829
02:48:09,587 --> 02:48:11,387
and the regrettable lack
of candor

2830
02:48:11,388 --> 02:48:14,357
in certain of your responses
to this board,

2831
02:48:14,358 --> 02:48:17,093
we have voted two-to-one

2832
02:48:17,094 --> 02:48:20,196
to deny the renewal
of your security clearance.

2833
02:48:20,197 --> 02:48:23,233
A full written opinion,
with a dissent from Mr. Evans,

2834
02:48:23,234 --> 02:48:26,836
will be issued to the AEC
in the coming days.

2835
02:48:26,837 --> 02:48:28,072
That is all.

2836
02:48:32,376 --> 02:48:34,011
Gordon.

2837
02:48:38,616 --> 02:48:40,451
Robert.

2838
02:48:41,085 --> 02:48:42,153
Robert.

2839
02:48:45,222 --> 02:48:46,690
Don't, uh...

2840
02:48:49,326 --> 02:48:50,961
Don't take in the sheets.

2841
02:48:55,466 --> 02:48:58,334
- Sir.
- Two minutes. Two minutes.

2842
02:48:58,335 --> 02:49:00,237
You'll get your shot.

2843
02:49:03,808 --> 02:49:05,175
Is it official?

2844
02:49:07,178 --> 02:49:11,181
Well, there were
a couple of unexpected holdouts.

2845
02:49:16,353 --> 02:49:18,988
I'm denied. Yeah?

2846
02:49:18,989 --> 02:49:20,991
I'm afraid so, sir.
All right.

2847
02:49:28,499 --> 02:49:29,666
Who were the holdouts?

2848
02:49:29,667 --> 02:49:32,569
Um... There were three,

2849
02:49:32,570 --> 02:49:34,971
led by the junior senator
from Massachusetts.

2850
02:49:34,972 --> 02:49:37,140
Young guy trying to make
a name for himself,

2851
02:49:37,141 --> 02:49:39,609
didn't like
what you did to Oppenheimer.

2852
02:49:39,610 --> 02:49:40,878
What's his name?

2853
02:49:41,579 --> 02:49:44,882
Uh, Kennedy. John F. Kennedy.

2854
02:49:48,519 --> 02:49:49,887
Kitty?

2855
02:49:55,860 --> 02:49:59,395
Did you think that if you
let them tar and feather you,

2856
02:49:59,396 --> 02:50:01,765
that the world
would forgive you?

2857
02:50:05,436 --> 02:50:07,071
It won't.

2858
02:50:09,306 --> 02:50:10,708
We'll see.

2859
02:50:20,517 --> 02:50:22,119
Goddamn it.

2860
02:50:24,855 --> 02:50:26,856
You told me I'd be okay.

2861
02:50:26,857 --> 02:50:29,359
Yeah, well, I didn't have
all the facts, did I?

2862
02:50:29,360 --> 02:50:30,760
Here's a fact.

2863
02:50:30,761 --> 02:50:32,662
President Eisenhower
pinned the Medal of Freedom

2864
02:50:32,663 --> 02:50:34,397
on my chest last year,

2865
02:50:34,398 --> 02:50:36,699
'cause I've always done
what's right for this country.

2866
02:50:36,700 --> 02:50:39,002
They don't want me
in the Cabinet room?

2867
02:50:39,003 --> 02:50:41,437
Oh, that's... That's fine.

2868
02:50:41,438 --> 02:50:44,140
Maybe they should just invite
Oppenheimer instead.

2869
02:50:44,141 --> 02:50:45,942
Maybe they will.

2870
02:50:45,943 --> 02:50:49,946
I told you, he turned the
scientists against me one by one,

2871
02:50:49,947 --> 02:50:51,347
starting with Einstein.

2872
02:50:51,348 --> 02:50:53,716
I told you about Einstein.
I saw him by the pond.

2873
02:50:53,717 --> 02:50:55,451
You did, but you know, sir,

2874
02:50:55,452 --> 02:50:59,022
since nobody really knows what
they said to each other that day,

2875
02:50:59,023 --> 02:51:02,725
is it possible they didn't
talk about you at all?

2876
02:51:02,726 --> 02:51:05,195
Is it possible
they spoke about something

2877
02:51:06,297 --> 02:51:07,664
more important?

2878
02:51:07,665 --> 02:51:09,633
Mr. Strauss!

2879
02:51:18,509 --> 02:51:20,310
Oh!

2880
02:51:22,579 --> 02:51:23,946
Thank you.

2881
02:51:23,947 --> 02:51:25,315
Albert.

2882
02:51:26,483 --> 02:51:28,484
Ah...

2883
02:51:28,485 --> 02:51:30,187
The man of the moment.

2884
02:51:34,024 --> 02:51:37,260
You once held
a reception for me.

2885
02:51:37,261 --> 02:51:40,663
In Berkeley. You gave
me an award, Mmm? Yes.

2886
02:51:40,664 --> 02:51:45,301
You all thought that I had
lost the ability to understand

2887
02:51:45,302 --> 02:51:47,036
what I'd started.

2888
02:51:47,037 --> 02:51:50,740
So, the award
really wasn't for me.

2889
02:51:50,741 --> 02:51:53,277
It was for all of you, hmm?

2890
02:51:54,845 --> 02:51:57,113
Now it's your turn

2891
02:51:57,114 --> 02:52:01,785
to deal with the consequences
of your achievement.

2892
02:52:02,686 --> 02:52:04,153
And one day,

2893
02:52:04,154 --> 02:52:06,623
when they've
punished you enough...

2894
02:52:08,158 --> 02:52:12,029
they'll serve you
salmon and potato salad.

2895
02:52:16,367 --> 02:52:17,534
Make speeches...

2896
02:52:19,336 --> 02:52:20,971
...give you a medal.

2897
02:52:22,740 --> 02:52:24,107
Hello, Frank.

2898
02:52:24,108 --> 02:52:25,843
You're happy, I'm happy.

2899
02:52:32,616 --> 02:52:35,786
Pat you on the back,
tell you all is forgiven.

2900
02:52:37,454 --> 02:52:38,689
Just remember...

2901
02:52:40,190 --> 02:52:42,259
it won't be for you.

2902
02:52:47,398 --> 02:52:48,899
It'll be for them.

2903
02:53:02,279 --> 02:53:03,747
Albert.

2904
02:53:05,115 --> 02:53:08,451
When I came to you
with those calculations,

2905
02:53:08,452 --> 02:53:10,753
we thought we might start
a chain reaction

2906
02:53:10,754 --> 02:53:14,424
that would destroy
the entire world?

2907
02:53:15,192 --> 02:53:18,996
Mmm. I remember it well.
What of it?

2908
02:53:22,733 --> 02:53:24,401
I believe we did.
