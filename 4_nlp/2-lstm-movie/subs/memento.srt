1
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,940
<i>So where are you?</i>

2
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,980
<i>You're in some motel room.</i>

3
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,140
<i>You just wake up and you're in...</i>

4
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,420
<i>... in a motel room. There's the key.</i>

5
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:39,020
<i>It feels like maybe it's the first time
you've been here but...</i>

6
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,580
<i>... perhaps you've been there for a week...</i>

7
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,140
<i>... three months, it's...</i>

8
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,340
<i>It's kind of hard to say, I... I don't know.</i>

9
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:50,100
<i>It's just an anonymous room.</i>

10
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:54,780
This guy. He's here already.

11
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,580
Lenny!

12
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:00,100
It's Leonard.

13
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:04,740
- Like I told you before.
- Did you? I must have forgot.

14
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,740
I guess I've already told you
about my condition.

15
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:11,060
Oh, well, only every time I see you.

16
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,500
- My car.
- This "is" your car.

17
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,700
Oh, you're in a playful mood.

18
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:28,940
- It's not good to make fun of a handicap.
- Just trying to have a little fun.

19
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:38,620
- Roll up your window.
- Hm?

20
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,980
- It's broken.
- I can get that fixed for you.

21
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:48,020
- So, where to, Sherlock?
- I got a lead on a place.

22
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:51,260
- What the hell you wanna go there for?
- You know it?

23
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:55,140
Yeah, it's just this fucked up building.
Why do you wanna go there?

24
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:58,860
Don't remember.

25
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:20,780
- Looks like somebody's home.
- Ah, that thing's been here for years.

26
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:25,540
What are you talking about?
These tracks are only a few days old.

27
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:29,260
Tracks? What are you, Pocahontas?

28
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,380
Come on.

29
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,980
Let's take a look inside.

30
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,220
<i>Teddy.</i>

31
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:03,300
<i>Don't believe his lies. 
He is the one. Kill him.</i>

32
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,340
<i>I've finally found him.</i>

33
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,540
<i>How long have I been looking?</i>

34
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,940
Find anything?

35
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,980
Didn't think so.

36
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,340
Let's go, huh?

37
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,620
Oh, fuck this.

38
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,020
You're gonna pay for what you did.

39
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:24,660
Beg forgiveness and then you pay.

40
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,380
You don't have a clue, you freak!

41
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,100
Beg my wife's forgiveness
before I blow your brains out.

42
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:36,020
Leonard, you don't know what's going on.

43
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,460
- You don't even know my name.
- Teddy.

44
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,620
Cos you read it off a fucking picture.

45
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,860
You don't know who you are.

46
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:48,300
- I'm Leonard Shelby from San Francisco.
- That's who you were. That's not...

47
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,220
...what you've become.

48
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,740
- Shut your mouth.
- You want to know, Lenny? Come on.

49
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,780
Come on, let's go down to the basement.

50
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,700
Let's go down, you and me together.

51
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:03,500
Then you'll know who you really are.

52
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,580
- No!

53
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,420
<i>It's just an anonymous room.</i>

54
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,900
<i>There's nothing in the drawers. 
But you look anyway.</i>

55
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,340
<i>Nothing except the Gideon Bible...</i>

56
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:19,140
<i>... which I, of course, read religiously. 
Hm.</i>

57
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:24,020
<i>You know who you are
and you know kind of all about yourself.</i>

58
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:28,860
<i>But just for day-to-day stuff, 
notes are really useful.</i>

59
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:33,660
<i>Sammy Jankis had the same problem
but he really had no system.</i>

60
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:37,900
<i>He wrote himself a ridiculous amount
of notes but he'd get them all mixed up.</i>

61
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,020
<i>You really do need a system if...</i>

62
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:44,020
<i>... if you're gonna make it work.</i>

63
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,540
- Hi.
- Hi.

64
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,740
- I'm Mr Shelby from 304.
- What can I do for you, Leonard?

65
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,620
- Um...
- Burt.

66
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,900
Burt. I'm not sure, I think
I may have asked you to hold my calls.

67
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,700
- You don't know?
- I'm not too good on the phone.

68
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,460
You said you like to look people in the eye
when you talk to them.

69
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,780
Yeah, yeah.

70
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:55,540
- You don't remember saying that.
- I have this condition.

71
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,900
- A condition?
- It's my memory.

72
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:00,500
- Amnesia?
- No, no, it's different from that.

73
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:04,620
I have no short-term memory.
I know all about myself, I just...

74
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:08,380
Since my injury I can't make
new memories. Everything fades.

75
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:11,860
If we talk for too long
I'll forget how we started...

76
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,500
...and next time I see you
I won't remember this conversation.

77
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:17,140
I don't even know if I've met you before.

78
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:21,820
So if I seem a little strange
or rude, or something, uh...

79
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:24,340
I've told you this before, haven't I?

80
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:28,340
I don't mean to mess with you
but it's so weird.

81
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,540
- You don't remember me at all?
- No.

82
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:34,300
- We've talked a bunch of times.
- I'm sure we have.

83
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:36,460
What's the last thing you remember?

84
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,740
My wife.

85
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:42,460
What's it like?

86
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,860
It's like waking.

87
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,580
It's like you just woke up.

88
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,620
That must suck.

89
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,260
It's all backwards.

90
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,140
Like, maybe you got an idea
about what you want to do next...

91
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,340
...but you don't remember
what you just did.

92
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,900
I mean, I'm exactly the opposite...

93
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,940
- How long have I been staying here?
- Couple of days.

94
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,380
- And you're holding my calls?
- Like you said.

95
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,780
OK, but this guy's an exception.

96
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:11,500
You know this guy?

97
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:15,260
- Yeah, it's your friend, right?
- What makes you think that?

98
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,580
- I saw you together, that's all.
- He's not my friend.

99
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,020
OK.

100
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:22,660
If he calls or shows up here,
give me a call in my room, OK?

101
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,700
- What, his name's Teddy?
- Teddy, yeah.

102
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,820
All right.

103
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,700
Look, I hope my condition's
not gonna be a problem for you.

104
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,580
Not as long as you remember
to pay the bill.

105
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,620
Yeah. OK.

106
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,660
Forty.

107
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:40,780
This guy.

108
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:43,740
He's here already.

109
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,740
Lenny!

110
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:50,780
<i>You really need a system
if you're gonna make it work.</i>

111
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:55,220
<i>You kinda learn to trust your handwriting. 
It becomes an important part of your life.</i>

112
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:59,100
<i>You write yourself notes. 
Where you put them is really important.</i>

113
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,780
<i>You need a jacket that's got, 
like, six pockets...</i>

114
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,860
<i>... particular pockets
for particular things.</i>

115
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:08,140
<i>You just kinda learn to know where
things go and how the system works.</i>

116
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,500
<i>You have to be wary of other people
writing stuff for you...</i>

117
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,540
<i>... that is not going to make sense
or is gonna lead you astray.</i>

118
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,740
<i>I don't know what makes people
take advantage...</i>

119
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,780
<i>... of somebody with this condition.</i>

120
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:22,100
<i>If you have a piece of information
which... is...</i>

121
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:26,060
<i>... vital, writing on your body instead of
on a piece of paper can be the answer.</i>

122
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,180
<i>It's a permanent way of keeping a note.</i>

123
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:38,620
Who is this?

124
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:48,540
<i>Remember Sammy Jankis.</i>

125
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:18,260
- Sir, you left these at your table.
- Thanks.

126
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,340
Ah, Lincoln Street?

127
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,180
Just go straight out on Sixth Street...

128
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,340
...go east through town...
- I'm gonna write this down.

129
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:29,260
- Oh, it's easy. Go straight out...
- Trust me, I need to write this down.

130
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:37,860
<i>The Discount Inn.</i>

131
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,620
<i>Discount Inn.</i>

132
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:05,340
<i>Natalie.</i>

133
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:08,580
<i>My car.</i>

134
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:12,180
<i>Teddy.</i>

135
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:26,460
<i>John Edward Gammell.</i>

136
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:29,980
This guy told me his name was Teddy.

137
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:36,580
<i>Don't believe his lies.</i>

138
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,540
<i>- Yeah?
- Mr Gammell?</i>

139
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,580
<i>- Lenny, is that you?
- John Gammell?</i>

140
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,980
<i>Lenny, it's Teddy. 
Stay there. I'll be right over.</i>

141
00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:00,700
- OK. I'll be waiting.

142
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:57,980
White male.

143
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:00,140
First name, John.

144
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:05,580
Last name G for Gammell.

145
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,660
Drugs.

146
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,460
License plate.

147
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:16,380
SG13...

148
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:20,140
...7IU.

149
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:26,620
It's him.

150
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:34,420
I've found you, you fuck.

151
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,900
You said we talked before.
I don't remember that.

152
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,940
Yeah, but it's not amnesia.

153
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,340
I remember up until my injury,
I just can't make new memories.

154
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,580
So I can't remember talking to you.
What did we talk about?

155
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,620
Oh, Sammy Jankis.

156
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:45,260
I guess I tell people about Sammy
to help them understand.

157
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,460
Sammy's story helps me understand
my own situation.

158
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,100
Sammy wrote himself
endless amounts of notes.

159
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,580
But he got mixed up.

160
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:58,980
I have a more graceful solution
to the memory problem.

161
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,820
I'm disciplined and organised.

162
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,580
I use habit and routine
to make my life possible.

163
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,940
Sammy had no drive...

164
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:08,420
...no reason to make it work.

165
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:09,780
Me?

166
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,860
Yeah...

167
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:16,540
...I got a reason.

168
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:34,460
<i>Today, 1 pm, meet Natalie for info.</i>

169
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:40,260
<i>She has also lost someone. 
She will help you out of pity.</i>

170
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,340
- Natalie.
- You don't remember me.

171
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:00,620
- I should've explained. I have this cond...
- You did explain, Lenny.

172
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:03,580
Please call me Leonard.
My wife called me Lenny.

173
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:07,100
- I know, you told me.
- Then I probably told you I hated it.

174
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:09,020
Yeah.

175
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:13,580
Do you mind taking your glasses off?
It's hard for me to...

176
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:14,180
Thanks.

177
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,740
So, you have information for me?

178
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,460
- Is that what your little note says?
- Yeah.

179
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:22,860
Must be tough living your life
according to a couple of scraps of paper.

180
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:27,660
Mix your laundry list with your grocery list
and you'll end up eating your underwear.

181
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,260
I guess that's why you have
those freaky tattoos.

182
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,500
Yeah, it's tough. It's almost impossible.

183
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:38,620
Look, I'm sorry I don't remember you.
It's nothing personal.

184
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:42,660
I do have information for you.

185
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,580
You gave me a license-plate number.

186
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,420
Had my friend at DMV trace it.

187
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:51,340
Guess what name came up?

188
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:54,540
John Edward Gammell. John G.

189
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:55,860
Do you know him?

190
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:59,540
No. But his face on his driver's licence
looked really familiar.

191
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:02,180
I think he's been in the bar, maybe.

192
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:05,580
Here's a copy of his licence,
his registration, photo and all.

193
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,620
Are you sure you want this?

194
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:10,300
- Have I told you what this man did?
- Yeah.

195
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,620
Well, then you shouldn't have to ask.

196
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,860
Even if you get revenge,
you're not gonna remember it.

197
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,900
You're not even gonna know it happened.

198
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:20,180
My wife deserves vengeance. It doesn't
make any difference if I know about it.

199
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,500
Just because
there are things I don't remember...

200
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,820
...doesn't make my actions meaningless.

201
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:28,340
The world doesn't just disappear
when you close your eyes.

202
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:31,900
Anyway, maybe I'll take a photograph
to remind myself.

203
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:35,620
Get another freaky tattoo.

204
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:41,100
Tell me about her again.

205
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,540
Why?

206
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:46,940
Because you like to remember her.

207
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:50,420
She was beautiful.

208
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,660
- To me she was perfect.
- No.

209
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:56,380
Don't just recite the words.

210
00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:01,500
Close your eyes and remember her.

211
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:13,660
You can just feel the details.

212
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:19,460
The bits and pieces
you never bothered to put into words.

213
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,100
And you can feel these extreme moments.

214
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:28,580
<i>Even if you don't want to.</i>

215
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:34,020
<i>You put these together
and you get the feel of a person.</i>

216
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:38,300
Enough to know
how much you miss them.

217
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:48,180
<i>And how much you hate the person
who took them away.</i>

218
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:58,260
I, um, I added an address in here.

219
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,660
It might be useful.
It's an abandoned place outside of town.

220
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:06,220
Um, I guy I knew
used to do bigger deals there.

221
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,500
It's isolated.

222
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:12,220
Sounds perfect.

223
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:16,140
- Do I owe you any...
- I wasn't helping you for money.

224
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,340
- I'm sorry.
- It's OK.

225
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:22,100
See, you have this condition.

226
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:27,860
You still staying at the Discount Inn?
Room 304? Left it at my place.

227
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:34,580
Yeah.

228
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:39,060
- They treating you OK?
- I don't remember.

229
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:43,780
You know what we have in common?

230
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:47,980
We are both survivors.

231
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:53,220
You take care, Leonard.

232
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:21,100
<i>Remember Sammy Jankis.</i>

233
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:25,140
I met Sammy through work. Insurance.
I was an investigator.

234
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,620
I'd investigate the claims
to see which ones were phoney.

235
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,660
I had to see through people's bullshit.

236
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,340
It was useful experience
cos now it's my life.

237
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:35,580
When I meet someone,
I don't know if I've met them before.

238
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:38,020
I have to look in their eyes
and try and figure them out.

239
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:41,260
<i>My job taught me the best way to find out
what someone knew was let them talk.</i>

240
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,140
<i>Watch the eyes and the body language.</i>

241
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:47,260
<i>If someone scratches their nose, 
experts tell you it means they're lying.</i>

242
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,580
<i>It really means they're nervous. People
get nervous for all sorts of reasons.</i>

243
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:51,820
<i>It's all about context.</i>

244
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,860
Yeah, I was good.

245
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:58,660
Sammy was my first real challenge.

246
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:06,180
Yo, Lenny! I thought you'd split for good.

247
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,580
- Well, things change.
- So I see.

248
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:11,620
- My name's Teddy.
- I guess I've told you about my condition.

249
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:17,220
Only every time I see ya.
Come on, I'll buy you lunch.

250
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,100
- Have I told you about Sammy Jankis?
- Mmm. Yeah.

251
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,140
I'm sick of hearing about the guy.

252
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,340
What about John G?
You think he's still here?

253
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,900
- Who?
- Johnny G, the guy you're looking for.

254
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,340
- That's why you haven't left town, right?
- Maybe.

255
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:35,580
- Leonard, you have to be very careful.
- Why?

256
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:38,620
You mentioned that maybe somebody
was trying to set you up.

257
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,220
Get you to kill the wrong guy.

258
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:43,740
I go on facts, not recommendations,
but thank you.

259
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:46,740
Lenny, you can't trust a man's life
to your little notes and pictures.

260
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:49,500
- Why not?
- Because your notes could be unreliable.

261
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,220
- Memory's unreliable.
- Oh, please.

262
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:54,820
No, really. Memory's not perfect,
it's not even that good. Ask the police.

263
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:57,220
Eyewitness testimony is unreliable.

264
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,700
The cops don't catch a killer
by sitting around remembering stuff.

265
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:02,660
- They collect facts and draw conclusions.
- That's not what I'm saying.

266
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,820
Facts, not memories.

267
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:07,140
That's how you investigate.
I know, it's what I used to do.

268
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:11,220
Memory can change the shape of a room,
it can change the colour of a car.

269
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,420
And memories can be distorted.

270
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,460
They're an interpretation, not a record.

271
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,540
They're irrelevant if you have the facts.

272
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:20,500
You really want to get this guy, don't you?

273
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:25,660
He killed my wife.
He took away my fucking memory.

274
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:29,980
He destroyed my ability to live.

275
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,300
You're living.

276
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,380
Only for revenge.

277
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:37,420
Well, then we'll get the bastard.

278
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:41,260
Where are you staying?

279
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:46,300
The Discount Inn. I don't know what room.
I haven't got my key.

280
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:50,180
Probably left it in your room.

281
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,100
Hi.

282
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,340
I'm checked in here
but I think I've misplaced my key.

283
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:11,180
How you doing, Leonard?
Probably in the room, right?

284
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:29,860
- I don't see my key anywhere.
- Oh, shit. This is the wrong room.

285
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,740
You're in 304. I'm sorry. I fucked up.

286
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:34,500
- This is not my room?
- No. Come on, let's go.

287
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:38,060
Then why is this my handwriting?

288
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:44,180
Well... this "was" your room
but now you're in 304.

289
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:46,420
- When was I in here?
- Last week.

290
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:49,780
- Then I rented you another room on top.
- Why?

291
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:54,300
Business is slow, I mean, I told my boss
about your condition and stuff...

292
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,020
...he said rent him another room.

293
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:58,260
So how many rooms am I checked into
in this shit hole?

294
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,700
Just two. So far.

295
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:01,500
Well...

296
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:04,100
...at least you're being honest
about ripping me off.

297
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:08,580
- You're not going to remember anyway.
- You don't have to be that honest, Burt.

298
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:11,980
Leonard. Always get a receipt.

299
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:15,980
Oh, yeah. I'll write that down.

300
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:19,740
- Hey, what time is it?
- Quarter to one.

301
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,580
Excuse me.

302
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:24,900
Your room's...

303
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,700
- Natalie.
- You don't remember me.

304
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:40,580
I'd just become an investigator
when I came across Sammy.

305
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:44,220
Mr Samuel R Jankis, strangest case ever.

306
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:47,340
The guy's a 58-year-old,
semiretired accountant.

307
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,620
He and his wife were in this car accident,
nothing serious.

308
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:54,100
<i>But he's acting funny, 
he can't get a handle on what's going on.</i>

309
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:57,700
<i>The doctors find some possible damage
to the hippocampus, nothing conclusive.</i>

310
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:01,300
<i>Sammy can't remember anything
for more than a couple of minutes.</i>

311
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:02,740
<i>Can't work, can't do shit.</i>

312
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:06,980
<i>The medical bills pile up, his wife calls
the insurance company and I get sent in.</i>

313
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:12,020
<i>This is my first big claims investigation
so I really check into it.</i>

314
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:15,660
<i>Sammy can think just fine
but he can't make new memories.</i>

315
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:19,860
<i>He can only remember things
for a couple of minutes.</i>

316
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:22,900
<i>He'd watch TV but anything longer than
a couple of minutes was too confusing...</i>

317
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,980
<i>... he couldn't remember how it began.</i>

318
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:27,300
<i>He liked commercials. They were short.</i>

319
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:29,220
Sammy. It's time for my shot.

320
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:32,220
<i>The crazy part was that this guy...</i>

321
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,740
<i>... who couldn't follow
the plot of Green Acres anymore...</i>

322
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,820
<i>... could do the most complicated things...</i>

323
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:40,740
<i>... as long as he learned them
before the accident...</i>

324
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:44,420
<i>... and as long as he kept his mind
on what he was doing.</i>

325
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:47,340
<i>The doctors assure me...</i>

326
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:51,500
<i>... there's a real condition, anterial-grade
memory loss, or short-term memory loss.</i>

327
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:54,780
<i>It's rare but legit.</i>

328
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:57,660
<i>But every time I see him...</i>

329
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,220
<i>... I catch this look...</i>

330
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:03,580
<i>... this... slight look of recognition.</i>

331
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:06,340
<i>But he says he can't remember me at all.</i>

332
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:08,500
Sammy, it's OK. I got it.

333
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:11,220
- Hi, Mr Shelby.
- Hi, Mrs Jankis.

334
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:15,460
<i>Now, I can read people
and I'm thinking "bad actor".</i>

335
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:19,980
So now I'm suspicious
and I order more tests.

336
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:24,540
<i>Awake.</i>

337
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:28,900
<i>Oh, where am I?</i>

338
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:33,340
<i>Somebody's bedroom.</i>

339
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:36,460
<i>Oh, it must be her room.</i>

340
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:40,180
<i>But who is she?</i>

341
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:49,620
It's only me.

342
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:54,660
- Did you sleep OK?
- Yeah. You?

343
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:56,460
Oh, shit. Shit.

344
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:59,900
I gotta be someplace.

345
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,260
It's pretty weird.

346
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,940
It's useful. You never
write a phone number on your hand?

347
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:12,140
I, um, I should be able
to talk to my friend today...

348
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:15,180
...about the license plate.
- Yeah, the license plate.

349
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:19,300
John G's license plate.

350
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,980
You have it tattooed on your thigh.

351
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:43,500
<i>Natalie.</i>

352
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:49,340
<i>She has also lost someone. 
She will help you out of pity.</i>

353
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:54,580
If it's registered in this state...

354
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:56,860
...it should only take a couple seconds
to pull up his licence and registration.

355
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,300
I'll call you as soon as I talk to him.

356
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:03,900
Could we arrange a meeting now?
I'm not too good on the phone.

357
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:13,460
You know, it's great that you...

358
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,500
Well, that you're...

359
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,300
...helping me...

360
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:18,740
...like this.

361
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:23,700
I'm helping you because you helped me.

362
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:36,020
So next time you see me...

363
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:39,180
...will you remember me?

364
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:57,020
I think you will.

365
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:00,740
I'm sorry.

366
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:06,420
Lenny, before you go,
could I have my shirt back, please?

367
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:23,420
Yo, Lenny! I thought you'd split for good.

368
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:26,180
Sammy couldn't pick up
any new skills at all.

369
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:28,580
But I find something in my research.

370
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,180
Conditioning.

371
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:33,100
Sammy should still be able to learn
through repetition.

372
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:36,380
It's how you learn stuff like riding a bike.
You get better through practice.

373
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:38,620
It's a different part of the brain
from the short-term memory.

374
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:42,140
So I had the doctors
test Sammy's response to conditioning.

375
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:46,180
- Pick up any three objects.
- That's a test?

376
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:48,540
Where were you guys when I did my CPA?

377
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:51,660
Sorry.

378
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,020
Ta-da!

379
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:56,260
- Ow! What the fuck?

380
00:30:56,500 --> 00:31:00,340
- It's a test, Sammy.
- Test this, you fucking quack.

381
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:04,180
<i>Some of the objects were electrified. 
They'd give him a shock.</i>

382
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:07,260
They kept repeating the test,
always with the same objects electrified.

383
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:10,660
The point was to see if Sammy could
learn to avoid the electrified objects...

384
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:14,780
...not by memory, but by instinct.

385
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:37,020
Natalie, right? Who the fuck is Dodd?

386
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:40,300
Guess I don't have to worry about him
any more.

387
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:43,940
- What the fuck have you got me into?
- Shh. Come inside.

388
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:49,220
- Who is he?
- Calm down. OK?

389
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:52,660
This is my problem. You offered to help.
It's nothing to do with your investigation.

390
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,180
How did you get me into this?

391
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:56,220
You offered to help me
when you saw what he did to my face.

392
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:59,700
- How do I know he did that to your face?
- I came straight to you after he did it.

393
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,980
I showed you what he did
and I asked you to help me.

394
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:05,140
- Oh, and I just take your word?
- Yeah.

395
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:07,380
Something doesn't feel right.

396
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:09,780
I think someone's fucking with me,
trying to get me to kill the wrong guy.

397
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,140
- Did you?
- What?

398
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:13,060
Kill him?

399
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:17,020
- Course not!
- Hey. Sit down, OK? Sit.

400
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:22,420
This has nothing to do with you.
You helped me out and I'm grateful.

401
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:25,860
You have to burn them.

402
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:31,420
Leonard, you decided to help me.
Trust your own judgement.

403
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:34,820
You can question everything,
you can never know anything for sure.

404
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:38,340
- There are things you know for sure.
- Such as?

405
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:41,980
I know what that's gonna sound like
when I knock on it.

406
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:45,340
I know what that's gonna feel like
when I pick it up. See?

407
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:49,500
Certainties. It's the kind of memory
you take for granted.

408
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:53,420
You know, I can remember so much.

409
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,860
The feel of the world...

410
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:59,580
And her.

411
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:05,420
She's gone.

412
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:09,260
And the present is trivia
which I scribble down as fucking notes.

413
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,900
Hey, come on. Try and relax. Come on.

414
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:15,100
- It's not easy for me to relax.
- Shh. Shhh.

415
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:17,340
Come on, take your jacket off.

416
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:20,940
Here. Come on.

417
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:23,020
Hey.

418
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:26,740
Didn't think you were the type.

419
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:36,860
It's backwards.

420
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:41,180
Come here. Come here.

421
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:03,580
What about here?

422
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:07,700
Maybe it's... for when I find him.

423
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:12,260
I've lost somebody too.

424
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,300
I'm sorry.

425
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:16,220
His name was Jimmy.

426
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:19,300
- What happened to him?
- He went to meet somebody.

427
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:22,420
He never came back.

428
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:26,220
- Who did he go to meet?
- A guy called Teddy.

429
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:28,420
What do the police think?

430
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:32,660
They don't look too hard
for guys like Jimmy.

431
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,300
When you find this guy, this...

432
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:40,180
...John G, what are you gonna do?

433
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:44,460
I'm gonna kill him.

434
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:48,860
Maybe I can help you find him.

435
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:56,420
I don't even know how long
she's been gone.

436
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:02,940
It's like I've woken up in bed
and she's not here...

437
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:08,580
...because she's gone to the bathroom
or something.

438
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:13,020
But somehow I just...

439
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:18,940
I just know
she's never gonna come back to bed.

440
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:23,300
If I could just...

441
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:28,180
...reach over
and touch her side of the bed...

442
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:32,620
...I would know that it was cold.

443
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:36,940
But I can't.

444
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:42,420
I know I can't have her back.

445
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:47,620
But I don't want to wake up in the morning
thinking she's still here.

446
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:53,740
I lie here not knowing
how long I've been alone.

447
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:00,140
So how...

448
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:03,940
How can I heal?

449
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:08,340
How am I supposed to heal if I can't...

450
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:12,140
...feel time?

451
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:25,820
<i>She has also lost someone. 
She will help you out of pity.</i>

452
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:50,900
They kept testing Sammy for months.

453
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:53,860
<i>Always with the same objects
carrying the electrical charge.</i>

454
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,900
- Ow! What the fuck?

455
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:58,300
- It's a test, Sammy.
- Test this, you fucking quack!

456
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:00,380
Even with total short-term memory loss...

457
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:03,700
...Sammy should have learned instinctively
to stop picking up the wrong objects.

458
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:07,660
<i>Other cases responded to conditioning, 
Sammy didn't respond at all.</i>

459
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:11,180
<i>It suggested that his condition
was psychological not physical.</i>

460
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:15,620
We turned down his claim on the grounds
that he wasn't covered for mental illness.

461
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:19,660
His wife got stuck with the bills
and I got a big promotion.

462
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:23,500
Conditioning didn't work for Sammy,
so he became helpless.

463
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:25,540
But it works for me.

464
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:27,620
I live the way Sammy couldn't.

465
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:30,420
Habit and routine make my life possible.

466
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:34,860
Conditioning. Acting on instinct.

467
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,620
<i>Awake.</i>

468
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:47,020
<i>Where am I?</i>

469
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:49,420
<i>Motel room.</i>

470
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:53,140
Oh.

471
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:59,380
<i>Some anonymous motel room.</i>

472
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:04,460
<i>Nothing in the drawers. 
But I'll take a look anyway.</i>

473
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,500
<i>Nothing except the Gideon Bi...</i>

474
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:10,060
<i>Bible.</i>

475
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:24,340
- Hey! Open up!

476
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:26,380
- Just a minute!

477
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:28,980
Open the door!

478
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:32,420
- Lenny?

479
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:37,140
Open the door!

480
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:43,100
Come on!

481
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:46,820
- Hi, Teddy.
- Finished playing with yourself, Lenny?

482
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:51,460
- Oh!

483
00:39:57,660 --> 00:40:00,700
- Oh, I get it.

484
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:03,180
- Amorous neighbours.
- What are you doing here?

485
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:06,820
You called me.
You said you needed my help.

486
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:10,220
You know, I've had more
rewarding friendships than this one.

487
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:13,580
Although I do get to keep telling
the same jokes.

488
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:16,980
What the fuck is that?

489
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:22,940
Who the fuck is that?

490
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:25,100
- You don't know him?
- No! Should I?

491
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:29,140
- Wait a minute. Is that John G?
- I don't think so.

492
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:31,180
You don't think so?
You didn't write it down?

493
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:35,420
- I might have fallen asleep before I did.
- For Christ sakes!

494
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:39,140
Ask him.

495
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:43,820
What's your name? Your name?

496
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:45,860
- Dodd.
- And who did this to you?

497
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:48,460
- What?
- Who did this to you?

498
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:52,180
You did.

499
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:57,860
- I'm not going to help you kill that guy.
- No, no. Just let me think for a minute.

500
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:04,580
OK, Natalie. Who's Natalie? Natalie who?

501
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:06,820
- Why?
- Maybe I know her.

502
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:09,380
Look, we gotta get him out of here.

503
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:12,220
All right, all right, all right.

504
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:14,300
He's got to have a car, right?

505
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:17,540
We take him to his car, tell him to get the
fuck out of town or we're gonna kill him.

506
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:19,580
We can't walk him out of here
tied up and bleeding.

507
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:21,980
- How the fuck did you get him up here?
- I don't know!

508
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:25,580
- You don't know.

509
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:29,460
Yes, I do. This is not my room.
It must be his room. Great. Let's go.

510
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,500
- No, no, no. We can't just leave him here.
- Why not?

511
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:37,580
Because the maid's gonna walk in.
She'll see him, call the cops. He can ID us.

512
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:40,420
OK. We untie him, we clean him up...

513
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:42,500
...and we march him out of here
with a gun in his back.

514
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:45,660
A gun. Why would I have a gun?

515
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:49,940
It must be his. I don't think
they'd let someone like me carry a gun.

516
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:53,460
Fucking hope not.

517
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:02,500
Which one?

518
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:05,820
We should probably steal his car.
You know, teach him a lesson.

519
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:08,740
- Shut up.
- It's all right for you, you've got the Jag.

520
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:11,780
All right, get in.
I'm gonna ride with him, you follow us.

521
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:13,820
Give me your keys.

522
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:17,540
Take your own car.

523
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:43,780
So was he scared?

524
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:45,700
I think it was your sinister moustache.

525
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:48,500
Fuck you. Should have stolen his car.

526
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:54,060
- Why? What's wrong with this one?
- Nothing. You want to trade?

527
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:56,580
So what do you do now?

528
00:42:56,820 --> 00:43:01,420
I'm gonna find out
what the fuck that was all about.

529
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:10,300
Natalie, right? Who the fuck is Dodd?

530
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:14,060
Sammy's wife was crippled
by the cost of supporting him.

531
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:17,500
And fighting the company's decision.

532
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:20,140
But it wasn't the money that got to her.

533
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:22,580
<i>I never said that Sammy was faking.</i>

534
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:24,620
Sammy, I have an idea.

535
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:27,900
<i>Just that his problem was mental, 
not physical.</i>

536
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:30,580
You're gonna have a pen in your pocket.

537
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:32,420
<i>She couldn't understand.</i>

538
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:35,020
- I did something wrong?
- You did something wrong!

539
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:38,300
We're gonna deal with it.
We're gonna try a little harder.

540
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:41,260
<i>She looks into his eyes
and sees the same person...</i>

541
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:43,860
<i>... and if it's not a physical problem, 
he should snap out of it.</i>

542
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:44,900
- Ellen called!
- Ellen called.

543
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:47,820
Ellen called.
Ellen... Ellen can't come today!

544
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:50,380
- Ellen can't come!
- I'm so sorry! I'm sorry!

545
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:54,380
- I'm trying! I'm sorry!

546
00:43:55,860 --> 00:44:00,220
So, Leonard Shelby from the insurance
company gives her the seed of doubt.

547
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:02,820
Just like he gave it to the doctors.

548
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:05,220
But I never said that he was faking.

549
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:08,940
I never said that.

550
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:16,100
<i>Hm. I don't feel drunk.</i>

551
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:26,460
- Hello? Housekeeping.
- Oh, shit!

552
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:31,060
- Not right now!
- Oh, I'm sorry.

553
00:45:56,500 --> 00:46:02,860
<i>Dodd. Put him onto Teddy
or just get rid of him for Natalie.</i>

554
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:09,540
<i>Dodd.</i>

555
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:17,220
<i>Get rid of him. Ask Natalie.</i>

556
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:20,580
<i>Teddy, Teddy.</i>

557
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:31,260
<i>Yeah, leave your number, 
you know what to do.</i>

558
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:34,260
- Yeah. This is a message for Teddy.

559
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,420
I'm at the Mount Crest Inn on Fifth Street,
room six.

560
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:39,260
I need you to come over
as soon as you get this. It's important.

561
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:43,060
Oh, this is Leonard. Thanks. Bye.

562
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:45,580
Phew!

563
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:49,100
Fuck!

564
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:59,500
Mrs Jankis didn't understand that you
can't bully someone into remembering.

565
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:03,020
The more pressure you're under,
the harder it gets.

566
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:07,900
Ah. Well, then, call me back?

567
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:30,500
<i>OK. So what am I doing?</i>

568
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:34,300
<i>Oh, I'm chasing this guy.</i>

569
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:39,580
<i>No. He's chasing me.</i>

570
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:02,100
Ah! Fuck!

571
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:09,380
<i>Dodd, white guy, 
Mount Crest Inn on Fifth Street.</i>

572
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:12,940
<i>I'll get the jump on you, you fucker.</i>

573
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:50,260
Oh, fuck!

574
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:53,980
Sorry.

575
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:28,020
<i>I need a weapon.</i>

576
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:32,300
<i>This'll do.</i>

577
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:57,380
<i>Hm. I don't feel drunk.</i>

578
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:38,220
<i>Do I know this guy?</i>

579
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:42,140
<i>- He seems to know me.</i>

580
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:48,740
- What the fuck?

581
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:01,580
- I like your car.
- Thank you.

582
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:03,580
- Where'd you get it?
- Are you interested in buying one?

583
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:06,020
What, I haven't made
a strong enough impression on you?

584
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:10,340
- I wouldn't be too hard on yourself.

585
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:22,180
<i>OK. So what am I doing?</i>

586
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:34,260
Who is this?

587
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:51,900
Ouch! Cut it out.

588
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:22,780
- How can you read that again?
- It's good.

589
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:27,380
- You've read it, like, a thousand times.
- I enjoy it.

590
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:31,220
I thought the pleasure of a book was
in wanting to know what happens next.

591
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:36,380
Don't be a prick.
I'm not reading it to annoy you. I enjoy it.

592
00:53:36,740 --> 00:53:40,780
Just let me read. Please?

593
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:53,340
<i>Probably tried this before.</i>

594
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:58,540
<i>Probably burned truckloads of your stuff.</i>

595
00:53:58,940 --> 00:54:03,020
<i>Can't remember to forget you.</i>

596
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:19,380
Yeah.

597
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:21,500
Uh-huh.

598
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:26,580
Well, sir, that'd certainly be in keeping
with some of my own discoveries.

599
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:31,340
I was hoping for more on the drugs angle.
Will you hang on a sec?

600
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:41,020
The police report mentioned the drugs
found in the car outside my house.

601
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:43,100
The car was stolen.
His prints were all over it.

602
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:45,140
I got friends in the department.
They gave me a copy.

603
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:47,100
I dealt with the police a lot
in my insurance job.

604
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:52,540
With my condition it's really tough.
I can't keep it all in mind at once.

605
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:54,260
I have to summarise the sections.

606
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:57,420
There are pages missing.
I guess I've been trying to log them all.

607
00:54:57,660 --> 00:54:59,660
I don't know why these are crossed out.

608
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:01,740
They weren't even looking for John G.

609
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:04,500
The stuff they found in the car fit in with
what they believed had happened...

610
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:07,620
...so they didn't chase it up.

611
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:43,540
Honey?

612
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:47,900
Honey, it's late.

613
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:09,420
Everything OK?

614
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:28,940
<i>- You OK in there?</i>

615
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:32,500
Was it good for you?

616
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:38,420
What? Was I supposed to lock the door?

617
00:56:38,660 --> 00:56:41,460
No.

618
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:45,180
I'd like you to leave now.

619
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:06,580
There's something about the drugs
stashed in the car that doesn't ring true.

620
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:10,700
The police claim the guy was an addict
needing money to score. It's bullshit.

621
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:15,140
He's not gonna go breaking into places
while he's still got a stash that big.

622
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:19,380
Well, I think John G left it there.
Or planted it there.

623
00:57:19,620 --> 00:57:23,100
How do you know that?

624
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:25,260
Oh, shit, that's true. It fits.

625
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:27,620
So he's a dealer.

626
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:31,460
Hang on a sec.

627
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:42,220
Now we're getting somewhere.

628
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:44,660
<i>Discount Inn.</i>

629
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:35,500
Yeah, OK.

630
00:58:35,740 --> 00:58:38,260
Blonde's fine.

631
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:41,020
Well, that's what they say.

632
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:44,260
The Discount Inn. 304.

633
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:46,580
Leonard.

634
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:48,020
Well, what then?

635
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:51,060
We just go to bed.
You wait for me to fall asleep.

636
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:53,260
You go into the bathroom
and slam the door.

637
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:55,780
- Slam it?
- Yeah. Loud enough to wake me up.

638
00:58:56,020 --> 00:58:58,140
- And that's it?
- That's it.

639
00:58:58,380 --> 00:59:00,340
Ah...

640
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:04,980
Yeah, first I just need you
to put these things around the room.

641
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:09,980
Pretend they're your things
and this is your bedroom.

642
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:26,900
- Should I wear it?
- No, no, no. Uh, just like you took it off.

643
00:59:28,860 --> 00:59:32,100
I don't want you to use it. I'm sorry.

644
00:59:32,220 --> 00:59:39,020
I just mean put them around the room,
as if they were your... your things.

645
00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:44,500
Whatever gets you off.

646
01:00:05,980 --> 01:00:09,060
I can't blame the cops
for not taking me seriously.

647
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:11,940
This is a difficult condition to understand.
Look at Sammy Jankis.

648
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:14,020
His own wife couldn't deal with it.

649
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:16,700
I told you how she tried to get him
to snap out of it.

650
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:19,020
She came to see me at the office.
I found out all kinds of shit.

651
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:22,460
<i>She told me about life with Sammy. 
How she treated him.</i>

652
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:23,940
Thank you for seeing me.

653
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:26,580
She'd get Sammy to hide food
around the house...

654
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:29,340
...then she'd stop feeding him to see
if his hunger would make him remember.

655
01:00:29,580 --> 01:00:32,580
I've taken him to a parking lot and, uh...

656
01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:36,100
<i>She wasn't a cruel person. 
She just wanted her old Sammy back.</i>

657
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:38,860
You know all about Sammy
and you've decided he's faking.

658
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:41,580
The company's position
isn't that Sammy's faking anything...

659
01:00:41,820 --> 01:00:43,860
...just that his condition
can't be shown to be...

660
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:46,420
I just want to know
your honest opinion about Sammy.

661
01:00:46,660 --> 01:00:49,660
We shouldn't be talking like this
while the case is still open to appeal.

662
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:52,900
- I'm not appealing the decision.
- Then why are you here?

663
01:00:53,140 --> 01:00:58,660
Try to understand, when I look at Sammy,
I don't see some... vegetable.

664
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:01,860
I see my same old Sammy.

665
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:03,900
What do you think that's like for me...

666
01:01:04,140 --> 01:01:07,020
...to suspect that he might be imagining
this whole problem?

667
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:09,100
That if I just could say the right thing...

668
01:01:09,340 --> 01:01:13,460
...he'd snap out of it
and go back to being normal.

669
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:16,660
If I...

670
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:19,940
If I knew that my old Sammy
were truly gone...

671
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:26,500
...then I could say goodbye
and start loving this new Sammy.

672
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:29,580
As long as I have doubt
I can't say goodbye and move on.

673
01:01:29,820 --> 01:01:31,620
What do you want from me?

674
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:34,660
I want you to forget the company
you work for for thirty seconds...

675
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:39,220
...and tell me if you really believe
that Sammy's faking his condition.

676
01:01:39,460 --> 01:01:41,340
I need to know...

677
01:01:41,580 --> 01:01:45,460
...what you honestly believe.

678
01:01:48,060 --> 01:01:53,340
I believe that Sammy should be physically
capable of making new memories.

679
01:01:58,700 --> 01:02:01,700
Thank you.

680
01:02:01,940 --> 01:02:03,740
<i>I thought I'd helped her.</i>

681
01:02:03,980 --> 01:02:08,180
I thought she just needed an answer.
I didn't think it was important what it was.

682
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:12,500
Just that she had one to believe.

683
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:27,580
- A car this nice you should lock.
- Who the fuck are you?

684
01:02:27,820 --> 01:02:30,380
- Teddy, your buddy.
- Prove it!

685
01:02:30,620 --> 01:02:34,900
Remember Sammy?
You told me about Sammy!

686
01:02:35,100 --> 01:02:37,780
- Jeez!
- What the fuck are you doing in my car?

687
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:42,260
What, your sense of humour went with the
memory? Do you know why you're here?

688
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:44,300
- Unfinished business.
- Lenny...

689
01:02:44,540 --> 01:02:48,060
...let me inform you,
your business here is very much finished.

690
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:51,020
- You're still here because of Natalie.
- Who's Natalie?

691
01:02:51,260 --> 01:02:56,540
Schmuck! Whose house
do you think you just walked out of?

692
01:02:56,540 --> 01:03:01,260
That's right, take a look at your pictures.
I bet you got one of her.

693
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:04,740
Oh, nice shot, Leibovitz(!)

694
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:07,380
You'll want to make a note.
You can't trust her.

695
01:03:07,620 --> 01:03:08,780
Why's that?

696
01:03:09,020 --> 01:03:12,060
Because by now
she's taken a look at the suit and the car...

697
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:17,820
...and she's figuring out ways
of turning the situation to her advantage.

698
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:21,140
She's already got you staying with her,
for Christ sakes. You can't go back there.

699
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:23,060
Let me give you the name of a motel.

700
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:25,660
You're lucky I ran into you.
That broad's bad news.

701
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:29,140
- What do you mean, "bad news"?
- She's involved with drugs.

702
01:03:29,380 --> 01:03:30,460
Look. See these?

703
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:35,380
This is the bar where she works.
Her boyfriend's a drug dealer.

704
01:03:35,620 --> 01:03:38,100
She takes orders for him, arranges meets.

705
01:03:38,340 --> 01:03:40,740
He writes messages
on the back of these...

706
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:43,380
...then she slips him the answers
when she serves him his drinks.

707
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:47,300
- Why should I care?
- Because when she gets jammed up...

708
01:03:47,540 --> 01:03:49,340
...she's gonna use you to protect herself.

709
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:50,860
From who?

710
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:53,460
Guys are gonna wanna know
what happened to her boyfriend.

711
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:55,740
Guys are gonna come after her.

712
01:03:55,980 --> 01:03:58,540
Somebody's got to pay, Lenny.
Somebody always pays.

713
01:03:58,780 --> 01:03:59,980
Maybe she'll make it you.

714
01:04:00,220 --> 01:04:03,420
Oh, yeah?
Well, maybe she'll make it you. Is that it?

715
01:04:03,660 --> 01:04:05,620
You worried
that she's gonna use me against you?

716
01:04:05,860 --> 01:04:07,660
- No.
- Why not?

717
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:11,020
Because she doesn't know who I am.

718
01:04:11,260 --> 01:04:13,940
- Why are you following me?
- Maybe I wanna help.

719
01:04:14,180 --> 01:04:17,980
She doesn't know anything
about your investigation. OK, Einstein?

720
01:04:18,220 --> 01:04:20,540
So write this down.

721
01:04:20,780 --> 01:04:25,020
When she offers to help,
it'll be for her own reasons.

722
01:04:25,260 --> 01:04:29,660
I'm not lying.
Take my pen, write this down.

723
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:33,540
Do not trust her.

724
01:04:38,860 --> 01:04:40,660
There. You happy now?

725
01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:43,500
- I won't be happy until you leave town.
- Why not?

726
01:04:43,740 --> 01:04:46,460
You ever wonder
how long you can hang around here...

727
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:48,780
...before people start asking questions?
- What sort of questions?

728
01:04:49,020 --> 01:04:50,900
The same questions
you should be asking yourself.

729
01:04:51,140 --> 01:04:53,580
- Like what?
- Like how did you get this suit, the car?

730
01:04:53,820 --> 01:04:55,060
- I have money.
- From what?

731
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:58,380
My wife's death. I used to work
in insurance. We were well covered.

732
01:04:58,620 --> 01:05:00,460
Oh!

733
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:05,980
So in your grief
you wandered into a Jaguar dealership?

734
01:05:06,220 --> 01:05:09,820
You don't have a clue, do you?
You don't even know who you are.

735
01:05:10,060 --> 01:05:11,140
Yes, I do.

736
01:05:11,380 --> 01:05:14,740
I don't have amnesia. I remember
everything right up until the incident.

737
01:05:14,980 --> 01:05:16,780
I am Leonard Shelby,
I am from San Francisco...

738
01:05:17,020 --> 01:05:18,820
That's who you were.

739
01:05:19,060 --> 01:05:22,860
You do not know who you are.
What you've become since...

740
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:25,140
...the incident.

741
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:30,860
You wander around playing detective.
You don't even know how long ago it was.

742
01:05:31,100 --> 01:05:35,380
Let me put it this way. Were you wearing
designer suits when you sold insurance?

743
01:05:35,620 --> 01:05:39,700
- I didn't sell insurance, I investigated it.
- Right, right. You're an investigator.

744
01:05:39,940 --> 01:05:46,020
- Maybe you should investigate yourself.
- Oh, thank you for the advice.

745
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:49,500
Look, do me a favour,
don't go back in there.

746
01:05:49,740 --> 01:05:54,260
Will you take the motel out of town?

747
01:05:55,180 --> 01:05:58,980
It's been fun, Lenny.

748
01:06:03,820 --> 01:06:07,300
<i>Do not trust her.</i>

749
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:10,860
<i>Don't believe his lies.</i>

750
01:06:22,220 --> 01:06:25,180
Oh, fuck it. I need my own place.

751
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:33,860
No. She shouldn't have given me
that responsibility.

752
01:06:34,100 --> 01:06:37,580
I'm a claims investigator, not a doctor.

753
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:40,260
Yeah, yeah, I guess.

754
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:43,780
I've got all sorts of other considerations.

755
01:06:44,020 --> 01:06:47,940
Legal responsibility, large financ...

756
01:06:50,420 --> 01:06:54,900
- Who is this?

757
01:07:03,620 --> 01:07:04,700
Write this down.
Write down what happened.

758
01:07:04,940 --> 01:07:09,860
<i>Write it down. Come on, concentrate. 
Keep it in mind. Find a p...</i>

759
01:07:14,700 --> 01:07:17,300
- What happened?
- He beat the shit out of me.

760
01:07:17,540 --> 01:07:18,860
Who?

761
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:20,420
Who?

762
01:07:20,660 --> 01:07:22,860
Fuck, Leonard, Dodd!
Dodd beat the shit out of me.

763
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:24,020
Why?

764
01:07:24,260 --> 01:07:27,420
Because of you! Because I did what
you told me to do, reason with him...

765
01:07:27,660 --> 01:07:30,940
...tell him about Teddy. Great idea!
- Calm down. Calm down, take it easy.

766
01:07:31,180 --> 01:07:34,140
You're safe. It's OK.

767
01:07:34,380 --> 01:07:38,540
Come on. Just sit down. Sit down.

768
01:07:38,780 --> 01:07:41,100
Here, sit down.

769
01:07:41,340 --> 01:07:43,140
OK. You're OK.

770
01:07:43,380 --> 01:07:47,660
I'll just get some ice for your face.

771
01:07:52,940 --> 01:07:56,140
Here.

772
01:08:00,380 --> 01:08:03,180
I did exactly what you told me to do.

773
01:08:03,420 --> 01:08:06,580
I went to Dodd...

774
01:08:06,820 --> 01:08:10,660
...and I told him
that I didn't have any of Jimmy's money...

775
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:12,700
...or the drugs.

776
01:08:12,940 --> 01:08:16,940
And that this Teddy
must have taken everything.

777
01:08:17,180 --> 01:08:19,580
And what did he say?

778
01:08:19,820 --> 01:08:23,700
He didn't believe me.

779
01:08:24,020 --> 01:08:27,020
He said if I don't have the drugs
by tomorrow, he's gonna kill me.

780
01:08:27,260 --> 01:08:31,660
And then he just...
he just started hitting me.

781
01:08:31,900 --> 01:08:33,700
Where is he?

782
01:08:33,940 --> 01:08:36,580
- Why?
- I'll go see him.

783
01:08:36,820 --> 01:08:40,940
I'll give him some bruises of his own
and tell him to look for a guy called Teddy.

784
01:08:41,180 --> 01:08:44,860
Oh, he'll kill you, Lenny.

785
01:08:45,580 --> 01:08:49,780
- My wife used to call me Lenny.
- Yeah?

786
01:08:50,020 --> 01:08:52,420
Yeah, I hated it.

787
01:08:52,660 --> 01:08:57,260
Oh, this guy is so dangerous.
Let's just think of something else, OK?

788
01:08:57,500 --> 01:09:00,900
No, no, no.
You just tell me what he looks like.

789
01:09:01,140 --> 01:09:04,220
And where I can find him.
Have you got a pen?

790
01:09:04,460 --> 01:09:07,940
In my purse.

791
01:09:15,260 --> 01:09:17,700
He'll, um... he'll probably find you.

792
01:09:17,940 --> 01:09:19,020
What do you mean?

793
01:09:19,260 --> 01:09:20,980
I told him about your car.

794
01:09:21,220 --> 01:09:23,900
Why?

795
01:09:24,140 --> 01:09:28,620
He was beating the shit out of me,
I had to tell him something.

796
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:32,180
Just write it all down.

797
01:09:45,180 --> 01:09:47,100
Be careful.

798
01:09:47,340 --> 01:09:50,820
I'll be fine.

799
01:09:56,100 --> 01:10:00,500
- A car this nice you should lock.
- Who the fuck are you?

800
01:10:14,700 --> 01:10:18,940
Front desk? Burt, right.
This is Mr Shelby in room 21.

801
01:10:19,180 --> 01:10:20,980
Yeah, that's it, I don't want any calls.

802
01:10:21,220 --> 01:10:24,700
No, none at all.

803
01:10:33,380 --> 01:10:35,460
- What's wrong?
- Somebody's come already.

804
01:10:35,700 --> 01:10:37,500
- Who?
- Calls himself Dodd.

805
01:10:37,740 --> 01:10:38,940
What does he want?

806
01:10:39,180 --> 01:10:41,860
Wants to know what happened to Jimmy
and his money. He thinks I took it.

807
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:43,860
Did you?

808
01:10:44,100 --> 01:10:46,980
No.

809
01:10:49,180 --> 01:10:52,700
- What's this all about?
- You don't have a fucking clue, do you?

810
01:10:52,940 --> 01:10:54,820
You're just blissfully ignorant, aren't you?

811
01:10:55,060 --> 01:10:58,500
- Look, I have this condition.
- I know all about your fucking condition!

812
01:10:58,740 --> 01:11:01,980
I probably know more about it than you,
you don't have a clue about anything else.

813
01:11:02,220 --> 01:11:05,780
- What happened?
- Jimmy went to meet a guy named Teddy.

814
01:11:06,020 --> 01:11:08,420
He took a lot of money with him
and never came back.

815
01:11:08,660 --> 01:11:11,380
Jimmy's partners think I set him up.
I don't know if you know this Teddy.

816
01:11:11,620 --> 01:11:14,540
- Neither do I.
- Don't protect him! Help me.

817
01:11:14,780 --> 01:11:17,580
- How?
- Get rid of Dodd for me.

818
01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:20,020
- What?
- Kill him. I'll pay you.

819
01:11:20,260 --> 01:11:23,020
What do you think I am?
I'm not gonna kill someone for money.

820
01:11:23,260 --> 01:11:26,660
What, then? Love?
What would you kill for?

821
01:11:26,900 --> 01:11:29,340
- You'd kill for your wife, wouldn't you?
- That's different.

822
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:32,940
- Not to me, I wasn't married to her!
- Hey, don't talk about my wife.

823
01:11:33,180 --> 01:11:34,980
I can talk about whoever the fuck I want!

824
01:11:35,220 --> 01:11:37,420
I can say whatever I want
and you won't remember!

825
01:11:37,660 --> 01:11:39,580
I can call your wife a fucking whore
and we can still be friends.

826
01:11:39,820 --> 01:11:41,220
- Calm down.
- You can't get scared!

827
01:11:41,460 --> 01:11:43,900
You don't know how, you fucking idiot!

828
01:11:44,140 --> 01:11:45,900
This has nothing to do with me.

829
01:11:46,140 --> 01:11:49,780
How the fuck would you know?
You don't know a fucking thing!

830
01:11:50,020 --> 01:11:52,980
- Hey, can you get angry?
- Yes.

831
01:11:53,220 --> 01:11:55,260
You pathetic piece of shit!

832
01:11:55,500 --> 01:12:00,700
I can say whatever the fuck I want and
you won't have a clue, you fucking retard!

833
01:12:00,940 --> 01:12:04,740
I'm gonna use you. I'm telling you now
because I'm gonna enjoy it much more...

834
01:12:04,980 --> 01:12:08,740
...if I know that you could stop me
if you weren't such a fucking freak.

835
01:12:08,980 --> 01:12:11,220
Did you lose your pen? Too bad, freak.

836
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:15,140
Otherwise you could write yourself a note
about how much Natalie hates your guts...

837
01:12:15,380 --> 01:12:17,060
...and that I called your wife a whore!

838
01:12:17,300 --> 01:12:20,740
- Don't say another fucking word!
- About your whore of a wife?

839
01:12:23,020 --> 01:12:25,500
I read about your condition, Leonard.

840
01:12:25,740 --> 01:12:30,780
You know one of the causes of short-term
memory loss? Venereal disease.

841
01:12:31,020 --> 01:12:32,620
Maybe your cunt of a fucking wife...

842
01:12:32,860 --> 01:12:37,980
...sucked one too many diseased cocks
and turned you into a retard!

843
01:12:38,180 --> 01:12:42,420
You sad, sad freak.

844
01:12:43,140 --> 01:12:48,740
I can say whatever the fuck I want
and you won't remember.

845
01:12:48,980 --> 01:12:51,860
We'll still be best friends.

846
01:12:52,100 --> 01:12:55,900
Or maybe even lovers.

847
01:12:56,700 --> 01:12:59,180
Fuck!

848
01:13:02,580 --> 01:13:06,060
I'll see you soon.

849
01:13:11,260 --> 01:13:13,060
<i>- Stay focused.</i>

850
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:15,100
<i>Find a pen.</i>

851
01:13:15,340 --> 01:13:18,860
<i>I'm gonna write this down. 
I'm gonna write it down.</i>

852
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:22,220
<i>Concentrate, concentrate, concentrate.</i>

853
01:13:22,460 --> 01:13:27,340
<i>Keep it in mind, 
keep it in mind, keep it in mind.</i>

854
01:13:28,020 --> 01:13:30,140
<i>Come on. I've got to find a pen. 
I've got to find a pen.</i>

855
01:13:30,380 --> 01:13:34,020
<i>Now, write this down, write this down. 
Exactly what happened.</i>

856
01:13:34,260 --> 01:13:36,740
<i>I'm gonna write down what happened. 
Come on, come on! I've got to find a pen!</i>

857
01:13:36,980 --> 01:13:39,700
<i>Jeez! Come on! Come on, keep focused.</i>

858
01:13:39,940 --> 01:13:41,020
<i>Keep focused.</i>

859
01:13:41,260 --> 01:13:44,260
<i>Keep... Keep it in mind. 
Come on, find a pen.</i>

860
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:46,780
<i>Write this note. 
Write down what happened. Write it down.</i>

861
01:13:47,020 --> 01:13:50,780
<i>Come on, concentrate. 
Keep it in mind. Find a p...</i>

862
01:13:57,580 --> 01:13:58,500
What happened?

863
01:13:58,740 --> 01:14:00,540
What does it look like?
He beat the shit out of me.

864
01:14:00,780 --> 01:14:02,580
- Who?
- Who?

865
01:14:02,820 --> 01:14:07,540
Fuck, Leonard, Dodd!
Dodd beat the shit out of me.

866
01:14:14,380 --> 01:14:17,860
- Hello?

867
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:23,260
It's Burt, from the front desk.

868
01:14:23,340 --> 01:14:24,540
Yeah?

869
01:14:24,780 --> 01:14:28,740
I know you said you didn't want any calls
but this guy on the phone says he's a cop.

870
01:14:28,980 --> 01:14:30,820
- A cop?
- Yeah.

871
01:14:31,060 --> 01:14:34,020
He says you're really gonna wanna know
what he has to say.

872
01:14:34,260 --> 01:14:37,260
I'm not too good on the phone.
I need to look people in the eye.

873
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:40,780
Well, what...

874
01:14:42,660 --> 01:14:45,420
You can, um, you can crash on the couch.

875
01:14:45,660 --> 01:14:48,260
It's comfortable. Just have a seat.

876
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:51,780
Thanks.

877
01:14:54,940 --> 01:14:57,500
So, how long do you think
it's gonna take you?

878
01:14:57,740 --> 01:14:58,540
Hm?

879
01:14:58,780 --> 01:15:02,420
You told me you were looking
for the guy who killed your wife.

880
01:15:02,660 --> 01:15:09,780
Oh, it depends on if he's here in town
or if he's moved on. I have my file here.

881
01:15:10,060 --> 01:15:11,860
Can I ask you something?

882
01:15:12,100 --> 01:15:17,380
If you have all that information,
why haven't the police found him for you?

883
01:15:17,620 --> 01:15:20,420
- They're not looking for him.
- Why not?

884
01:15:20,660 --> 01:15:23,180
They don't think he exists.

885
01:15:23,420 --> 01:15:30,700
You see, I told them what I remembered.
I was asleep. Something woke me up.

886
01:15:34,660 --> 01:15:39,740
Her side of the bed was cold.
She'd obviously been gone for a while.

887
01:16:34,100 --> 01:16:36,500
There had to be a second man.

888
01:16:36,740 --> 01:16:38,940
Somebody hit me from behind.
I remember.

889
01:16:39,180 --> 01:16:40,620
It's the last thing I do remember.

890
01:16:40,860 --> 01:16:43,300
Look, the police didn't believe me.
If we check...

891
01:16:43,540 --> 01:16:48,740
How did they explain what you
do remember? The gun and stuff?

892
01:16:49,940 --> 01:16:51,980
John G was clever.

893
01:16:52,220 --> 01:16:53,820
He was clever.

894
01:16:54,060 --> 01:16:58,660
He took the dead man's gun and
replaced it with the sap he hit me with.

895
01:16:58,900 --> 01:17:02,700
He left my gun and the getaway car.
He gave the police a complete package.

896
01:17:02,940 --> 01:17:07,300
They found the sap with my blood on it
in the dead man's hand.

897
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:09,700
And they only found my gun.

898
01:17:09,940 --> 01:17:12,740
They didn't need to look for anybody else.

899
01:17:12,980 --> 01:17:16,700
I was the only guy who disagreed
with the facts and I had brain damage.

900
01:17:16,940 --> 01:17:19,740
The cops are not gonna believe
someone in my condition.

901
01:17:19,980 --> 01:17:24,380
Leonard. You can stay here
for a couple of days if it will help you.

902
01:17:24,620 --> 01:17:26,500
Oh, thanks.

903
01:17:26,740 --> 01:17:30,940
I have to go back to work,
so, um, just make yourself at home.

904
01:17:31,180 --> 01:17:33,380
You can watch TV or have some food.

905
01:17:33,620 --> 01:17:35,900
Whatever you want, OK?
Make yourself at home.

906
01:17:36,140 --> 01:17:39,140
One thing.

907
01:17:40,780 --> 01:17:46,500
- Something to remember you by.
- My name is Natalie.

908
01:17:46,740 --> 01:17:50,220
Natalie.

909
01:18:19,380 --> 01:18:21,340
- What's wrong?
- Somebody's come already.

910
01:19:08,620 --> 01:19:13,100
- On the house.
- Thanks.

911
01:19:15,740 --> 01:19:19,340
My, you really do have a problem.
Just like that cop said.

912
01:19:19,580 --> 01:19:23,340
- Hm?
- Your condition.

913
01:19:23,580 --> 01:19:26,260
Well, nobody's perfect.

914
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:31,580
What's the last thing
that you "do" remember?

915
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:34,940
- My wife.
- That's sweet.

916
01:19:35,180 --> 01:19:37,540
Dying.

917
01:19:37,860 --> 01:19:41,740
I remember my wife dying.

918
01:19:43,740 --> 01:19:46,340
Let me, um, get you another one.

919
01:19:46,580 --> 01:19:49,980
I think this one's dusty.

920
01:19:52,540 --> 01:19:55,180
Why are you calling me?
What do you want?

921
01:19:55,420 --> 01:19:58,820
I know you're a cop. What do you want?
Have I done something wrong?

922
01:19:59,060 --> 01:20:02,540
I don't know, something bad, maybe.

923
01:20:02,780 --> 01:20:04,980
Look, why are you asking me?
I can't remember what I've done.

924
01:20:05,220 --> 01:20:07,020
You wouldn't believe me anyway.

925
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:09,940
Because of my condition, you don't
believe someone with this condition.

926
01:20:10,180 --> 01:20:13,340
Nobody believed Sammy!
I didn't even fucking believe Sammy!

927
01:20:13,580 --> 01:20:17,060
<i>Ferdy's bar.</i>

928
01:20:17,620 --> 01:20:21,540
<i>Come by after. Natalie.</i>

929
01:20:34,340 --> 01:20:36,060
- A beer, please.
- What do you want?

930
01:20:36,300 --> 01:20:37,100
A beer, please.

931
01:20:37,340 --> 01:20:39,500
You can't just waltz in here
dressed like that and ask for a beer.

932
01:20:39,740 --> 01:20:41,820
- What, is there a dress code?
- Why are you here?

933
01:20:42,060 --> 01:20:44,740
- I'm meeting someone called Natalie.
- Well, that's me.

934
01:20:44,980 --> 01:20:48,180
Yeah, we met before, right?

935
01:20:48,420 --> 01:20:50,420
- Then why am I here?
- I don't know, why don't you tell me?

936
01:20:50,660 --> 01:20:52,460
I don't remember.
I have no short-term memory.

937
01:20:52,700 --> 01:20:54,260
Oh, you're that memory guy.

938
01:20:54,500 --> 01:20:57,940
- How do you know about me?
- My boyfriend told me about you.

939
01:20:58,180 --> 01:21:02,860
- Oh, yeah? Who's your boyfriend?
- Jimmy Grants. Do you know him?

940
01:21:03,100 --> 01:21:04,300
No.

941
01:21:04,540 --> 01:21:09,500
He knows you. He told me about you.
He said you were staying at the Discount.

942
01:21:09,740 --> 01:21:12,740
In fact, a cop came by earlier
and was looking for you.

943
01:21:12,980 --> 01:21:14,860
Said he was looking for a guy
who can't remember anything...

944
01:21:15,100 --> 01:21:16,900
...wouldn't know how he'd got here
or what he'd done.

945
01:21:17,140 --> 01:21:18,820
I get a lot of guys round here like that.

946
01:21:19,060 --> 01:21:24,860
Chronic alcoholism
is one cause of short-term memory loss.

947
01:21:24,980 --> 01:21:27,780
- Are you Teddy?
- No, my name's Leonard.

948
01:21:28,020 --> 01:21:30,420
- Did Teddy send you?
- I don't know.

949
01:21:30,660 --> 01:21:32,460
What's happened to Jimmy?

950
01:21:32,700 --> 01:21:36,100
- I don't know that, either. Sorry.
- You don't remember anything?

951
01:21:36,340 --> 01:21:39,620
You don't remember where you've been
or what you've just done?

952
01:21:39,860 --> 01:21:43,100
I can't make new memories.
Everything just fades.

953
01:21:43,340 --> 01:21:47,500
- Then why did you come here?
- I found this in my pocket.

954
01:21:49,140 --> 01:21:52,700
Your pocket?

955
01:22:14,540 --> 01:22:17,100
Bar bet. Care to contribute?

956
01:22:17,340 --> 01:22:19,820
- No, thanks.
- It's for a lot of money.

957
01:22:20,060 --> 01:22:25,340
Come on. Proceeds are going to charity.
Help me out.

958
01:22:34,740 --> 01:22:37,980
Thank you.

959
01:22:52,700 --> 01:22:55,820
- On the house.
- Thanks.

960
01:22:59,420 --> 01:23:02,500
It's completely fucked
because nobody believes you.

961
01:23:02,740 --> 01:23:06,140
It's amazing what a little brain damage
will do for your credibility.

962
01:23:06,380 --> 01:23:08,460
I guess it's poetic justice
for not believing Sammy.

963
01:23:08,700 --> 01:23:13,140
You know the truth about my condition,
officer? You don't know anything.

964
01:23:13,380 --> 01:23:18,100
You feel angry, you don't know why.
You feel guilty, you have no idea why.

965
01:23:18,340 --> 01:23:21,540
You could do anything and not have
the faintest idea ten minutes later.

966
01:23:21,780 --> 01:23:24,500
Like Sammy.
What if I'd done something like Sammy?

967
01:23:24,740 --> 01:23:28,340
I didn't tell you?
What happened to Sammy and his wife?

968
01:23:28,580 --> 01:23:30,500
She came to see me at my office.

969
01:23:30,740 --> 01:23:35,300
<i>I didn't tell her what I really thought
but I never said that he was faking.</i>

970
01:23:35,540 --> 01:23:37,500
<i>Just that his condition was mental, 
not physical.</i>

971
01:23:37,740 --> 01:23:41,780
<i>I found out later that she went home
and gave Sammy his final exam.</i>

972
01:23:42,020 --> 01:23:46,260
Sammy? It's time for my shot.

973
01:24:00,100 --> 01:24:02,900
<i>She knew beyond a doubt
that he loved her,</i>

974
01:24:03,140 --> 01:24:07,260
<i>so she found a way to test him.</i>

975
01:24:17,220 --> 01:24:21,340
Sammy? It's time for my shot.

976
01:24:21,580 --> 01:24:25,060
Hm.

977
01:24:30,540 --> 01:24:33,980
<i>- She really thought she'd call his bluff. 
- There you go.</i>

978
01:24:34,220 --> 01:24:40,260
<i>Or she just didn't want to live with
the things she'd put him through.</i>

979
01:24:47,100 --> 01:24:49,980
Sammy?

980
01:24:50,540 --> 01:24:53,420
It's time for my shot.

981
01:24:57,820 --> 01:25:01,060
It won't hurt.

982
01:25:41,580 --> 01:25:44,580
<i>She went into a coma
and never recovered.</i>

983
01:25:44,820 --> 01:25:47,780
<i>Sammy couldn't understand
or explain what happened.</i>

984
01:25:48,020 --> 01:25:49,820
Oh!

985
01:25:50,060 --> 01:25:54,180
He's been in a home ever since.
He doesn't even know his wife is dead.

986
01:25:54,420 --> 01:25:57,500
I was wrong about Sammy
and I was wrong about his wife.

987
01:25:57,740 --> 01:26:01,580
She wasn't interested in the money.
She needed to understand his problem.

988
01:26:01,820 --> 01:26:05,220
<i>His brain didn't respond to conditioning
but he wasn't a con man.</i>

989
01:26:05,460 --> 01:26:08,580
<i>And when she looked into his eyes, 
she thought he could be the same person.</i>

990
01:26:08,820 --> 01:26:10,660
<i>When I looked into his eyes, 
I thought I saw recognition.</i>

991
01:26:10,900 --> 01:26:12,700
Now I know you fake it.

992
01:26:12,940 --> 01:26:15,740
If you think you're supposed to recognise
somebody, you pretend to.

993
01:26:15,980 --> 01:26:19,260
<i>You bluff it to get a pat on the head
from the doctors.</i>

994
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:23,980
You bluff it to seem less of a freak.

995
01:26:24,100 --> 01:26:26,580
What drug dealer?

996
01:26:50,620 --> 01:26:53,460
- Hey, Lenny, how you doing?
- It's private back here.

997
01:26:53,700 --> 01:26:56,420
- It's OK, we know each other. Right, kid?
- How did you know I was in here?

998
01:26:56,660 --> 01:26:58,420
The Jag's out front.

999
01:26:58,660 --> 01:27:01,380
What are you still doing here, Lenny?
There's plenty of tattoo parlours up north.

1000
01:27:01,620 --> 01:27:04,820
I guess I wanted to get something down
before it slipped my mind.

1001
01:27:05,060 --> 01:27:06,780
- Give me the keys, I'll move it.
- It'll be all right.

1002
01:27:07,020 --> 01:27:08,820
- Wait out there.
- Oh, for Christ...

1003
01:27:09,060 --> 01:27:12,620
Give me a minute,
I've got to get something for you.

1004
01:27:15,540 --> 01:27:20,460
<i>Fact six. Car licence SG13 7IU.</i>

1005
01:27:25,020 --> 01:27:29,500
Look, wait a minute, will ya?

1006
01:27:30,540 --> 01:27:32,580
- We gotta get you out of here.
- Why?

1007
01:27:32,820 --> 01:27:35,500
Oh, man. Come on, Leonard.
How many times I gotta tell you?

1008
01:27:35,740 --> 01:27:37,940
- It's not safe for you to hang around.
- Why not?

1009
01:27:38,180 --> 01:27:41,220
Because that cop's looking for you.
I gotta get you a new identity...

1010
01:27:41,460 --> 01:27:44,540
...some new clothes, a different car
would do for now. Put these on.

1011
01:27:44,780 --> 01:27:46,420
Whoa, whoa. What cop?

1012
01:27:46,660 --> 01:27:50,420
He's a bad cop. He's the one
that checked you into the Discount Inn.

1013
01:27:50,660 --> 01:27:54,260
He's been calling you for days, slipping
envelopes under your door, shit like that.

1014
01:27:54,500 --> 01:27:58,180
- How do you know this?
- He told me. He's been laughing at you.

1015
01:27:58,420 --> 01:27:59,620
- You're full of shit.
- No, I'm not.

1016
01:27:59,860 --> 01:28:01,660
He knows you're no good on the phone
so he's been calling you up.

1017
01:28:01,900 --> 01:28:03,660
Sometimes you don't answer the phone...

1018
01:28:03,900 --> 01:28:06,420
...so he slips shit under your door
to scare you into answering it...

1019
01:28:06,660 --> 01:28:11,460
...giving you a line of crap about John G
being a local drug dealer. Jimmy Grants.

1020
01:28:11,700 --> 01:28:14,220
- Who's Jimmy Grants?
- Leonard, Jimmy's the drug dealer.

1021
01:28:14,460 --> 01:28:17,660
The cop wants to know how his operation
is run. He's got some score in mind.

1022
01:28:17,900 --> 01:28:20,180
- Somehow you're involved.
- How do you know him?

1023
01:28:20,420 --> 01:28:25,740
I'm a snitch. He's a cop from out of town.
The local boys put us together.

1024
01:28:25,980 --> 01:28:28,060
If he knew I was helping you,
he'd fucking kill me.

1025
01:28:28,300 --> 01:28:31,780
So take these clothes, put them on
and get the fuck out of here.

1026
01:28:32,020 --> 01:28:35,340
Come on, Leonard, just go.

1027
01:28:53,300 --> 01:28:56,660
You "are" full of shit.

1028
01:28:57,860 --> 01:29:00,260
<i>Come by after. Natalie.</i>

1029
01:29:00,500 --> 01:29:03,860
<i>Ferdy's bar.</i>

1030
01:29:42,500 --> 01:29:46,140
Hey, Jimmy.

1031
01:29:46,140 --> 01:29:49,260
I'm sorry, I, uh,
thought you were somebody else.

1032
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:51,100
Sorry.

1033
01:29:51,340 --> 01:29:54,820
That's OK.

1034
01:30:06,500 --> 01:30:10,500
This Jimmy Grants deals drugs
out of the bar where his girlfriend works?

1035
01:30:10,740 --> 01:30:14,140
But he's not going to bring her along?
He'll come by himself, right?

1036
01:30:14,380 --> 01:30:18,100
I always figured the drugs angle
would be the best way to get him.

1037
01:30:18,340 --> 01:30:21,460
No, officer. I'm as ready as I'll ever be.

1038
01:30:21,700 --> 01:30:25,500
You're in the lobby?
What do you look like?

1039
01:30:25,740 --> 01:30:28,180
I'll be right there.

1040
01:31:08,020 --> 01:31:10,420
Lenny!

1041
01:31:11,060 --> 01:31:14,540
Officer Gammell?

1042
01:31:15,900 --> 01:31:19,380
Yeah. Come on.

1043
01:31:33,940 --> 01:31:37,340
- Hey, smile.
- Oh, don't, uh... Not here.

1044
01:31:37,580 --> 01:31:41,060
Over here.

1045
01:31:43,860 --> 01:31:46,260
Is it Officer or Lieutenant Gammell?

1046
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:49,220
You know what?
Don't write Gammell, just Teddy.

1047
01:31:49,460 --> 01:31:53,500
- Why?
- I'm undercover.

1048
01:31:54,580 --> 01:31:57,060
This is the directions, where he's going.

1049
01:31:57,300 --> 01:31:59,900
- My number's on the bottom if you...
- You're not coming?

1050
01:32:00,140 --> 01:32:04,340
Nah, it wouldn't be appropriate.

1051
01:32:06,620 --> 01:32:10,700
Nice picture. I look thin.

1052
01:32:11,820 --> 01:32:14,420
Hey, Lenny!

1053
01:32:14,660 --> 01:32:17,540
Make him beg.

1054
01:33:35,260 --> 01:33:38,740
Teddy!

1055
01:33:39,260 --> 01:33:41,900
Hey, Teddy!

1056
01:33:43,300 --> 01:33:46,580
Teddy!

1057
01:33:48,100 --> 01:33:50,060
Jimmy.

1058
01:33:50,300 --> 01:33:53,260
- What the fuck are you doing here?
- You Jimmy Grants?

1059
01:33:53,500 --> 01:33:55,260
Expecting any other Jimmys,
memory man?

1060
01:33:55,500 --> 01:33:59,420
- Do you remember me?
- Yeah, I remember you.

1061
01:33:59,660 --> 01:34:01,820
Where the fuck's Teddy?

1062
01:34:02,060 --> 01:34:04,620
Well?

1063
01:34:06,620 --> 01:34:08,300
Motherfuck!

1064
01:34:08,540 --> 01:34:10,860
What are you doing?

1065
01:34:11,420 --> 01:34:12,420
Strip.

1066
01:34:12,660 --> 01:34:16,540
- You're making a big fucking mistake!
- Strip!

1067
01:34:16,540 --> 01:34:19,340
My associates are not the kind of people
you wanna piss off.

1068
01:34:19,580 --> 01:34:21,020
Don't say anything else.

1069
01:34:21,260 --> 01:34:25,660
- I knew I couldn't trust that fuck!
- Take it off.

1070
01:34:29,220 --> 01:34:31,100
Your pants, too.

1071
01:34:31,340 --> 01:34:33,540
- Why?
- I don't wanna get blood on them.

1072
01:34:33,780 --> 01:34:37,460
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait, wait, wait!
Did he tell you what I was bringing?

1073
01:34:37,700 --> 01:34:41,340
- Take your fuckin' pants off!
- I've got two hundred grand in the car!

1074
01:34:41,580 --> 01:34:43,980
- Just take it!
- You think you can bargain with me?

1075
01:34:44,220 --> 01:34:46,300
- Just take the money and walk away.
- I don't want your fucking money.

1076
01:34:46,540 --> 01:34:48,700
Then, what?

1077
01:34:48,940 --> 01:34:53,620
- What do you want from me?
- I want my fucking life back!

1078
01:36:19,820 --> 01:36:22,500
Sammy.

1079
01:36:27,500 --> 01:36:29,380
<i>He said Sammy. 
How does he know about Sammy?</i>

1080
01:36:29,620 --> 01:36:33,100
Oh, fuck.

1081
01:36:50,620 --> 01:36:53,580
<i>What have I done?</i>

1082
01:36:53,820 --> 01:36:54,820
Hey, mister! I need help!

1083
01:36:55,060 --> 01:36:58,340
There's a guy in here, he's hurt bad.
We gotta get him to a doctor.

1084
01:36:58,580 --> 01:37:00,660
All right.

1085
01:37:00,900 --> 01:37:02,940
I don't know what happened.
I've got this memory thing.

1086
01:37:03,180 --> 01:37:05,860
- Do I know you?
- No. Don't worry, I'm a cop.

1087
01:37:06,100 --> 01:37:09,100
- Is he still breathing?
- Well, I don't know. Maybe.

1088
01:37:09,340 --> 01:37:13,980
- What the hell were you guys doing?
- I don't remember, I have this condition.

1089
01:37:14,220 --> 01:37:17,300
I hope it's not as serious as his
cos this guy's dead.

1090
01:37:17,540 --> 01:37:21,100
- Ow! Lenny! That shit kills!
- So you remember me now, huh?

1091
01:37:21,340 --> 01:37:25,620
- You "are" a fucking cop!
- And I'm the guy that helped you find him.

1092
01:37:25,860 --> 01:37:31,700
- Get up! Get up!
- Lenny, you got the wrong idea!

1093
01:37:32,940 --> 01:37:34,780
Who is that? He knew me.

1094
01:37:35,020 --> 01:37:37,420
Of course he did, he raped your wife,
he fucked up your brain.

1095
01:37:37,660 --> 01:37:39,460
Bullshit! He's not the guy.

1096
01:37:39,700 --> 01:37:43,260
His name is James F Grants. John G.
Check your tattoos.

1097
01:37:43,500 --> 01:37:47,620
- Why did he bring two hundred grand?
- What?

1098
01:37:48,020 --> 01:37:50,060
- What was it for?
- Amphetamines I told him I had.

1099
01:37:50,300 --> 01:37:53,580
- Is this a drug deal?
- No. Yeah, that and your thing.

1100
01:37:53,820 --> 01:37:57,020
Look, Jimmy's your guy. I figured
we'd make a few dollars on the side.

1101
01:37:57,260 --> 01:37:59,860
- How did he know me?
- The Discount Inn.

1102
01:38:00,100 --> 01:38:04,140
He dealt out of there. The guy at the front
desk let him know if anybody came round.

1103
01:38:04,380 --> 01:38:06,420
He called Jimmy
the minute he saw you taking a picture.

1104
01:38:06,660 --> 01:38:08,820
- You're fucking using me.
- No! You get half.

1105
01:38:09,060 --> 01:38:11,300
He knew about Sammy,
why would I tell him about Sammy?!

1106
01:38:11,540 --> 01:38:14,620
You tell everybody about Sammy!
Everybody who'll listen!

1107
01:38:14,860 --> 01:38:16,740
"Remember Sammy Jankis?"
"Remember Sammy Jankis?"

1108
01:38:16,980 --> 01:38:19,780
Great story.
Gets better every time you tell it.

1109
01:38:20,020 --> 01:38:23,620
So you lie to yourself to be happy.
There's nothing wrong with that.

1110
01:38:23,860 --> 01:38:28,660
We all do it. Who cares if there's a few
little details you'd rather not remember?

1111
01:38:28,900 --> 01:38:32,100
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- I don't know.

1112
01:38:32,340 --> 01:38:36,820
Your wife surviving the assault.
Her not believing your condition.

1113
01:38:37,060 --> 01:38:41,860
The torment and pain and anguish
tearing her up inside.

1114
01:38:42,100 --> 01:38:44,340
The insulin.

1115
01:38:44,580 --> 01:38:47,020
That's Sammy, not me.
I told you about Sammy.

1116
01:38:47,260 --> 01:38:49,980
Yeah, right.
Like you tell yourself over and over again.

1117
01:38:50,220 --> 01:38:53,420
Condtitioning yourself to remember,
learning through repetition.

1118
01:38:53,660 --> 01:38:56,220
Sammy let his wife kill herself.
Sammy ended up in an institution.

1119
01:38:56,460 --> 01:38:59,460
Sammy was a con man. A faker.

1120
01:38:59,700 --> 01:39:01,620
I never said that Sammy was faking.

1121
01:39:01,860 --> 01:39:04,460
You exposed him for what he was.
A fraud.

1122
01:39:04,700 --> 01:39:07,540
I was wrong. That's the whole point.

1123
01:39:07,780 --> 01:39:12,420
- See, Sammy's wife came to me...
- Sammy didn't have a wife.

1124
01:39:13,500 --> 01:39:17,780
It was your wife who had diabetes.

1125
01:39:21,900 --> 01:39:24,380
Ouch!

1126
01:39:24,900 --> 01:39:27,460
My wife wasn't diabetic.

1127
01:39:27,700 --> 01:39:31,180
You sure?

1128
01:39:33,900 --> 01:39:35,620
Ouch! Cut it out!

1129
01:39:35,860 --> 01:39:37,660
She wasn't diabetic.

1130
01:39:37,900 --> 01:39:41,340
You think I don't know my own wife?
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1131
01:39:41,580 --> 01:39:44,340
I guess I can only make you remember
the things you want to be true.

1132
01:39:44,580 --> 01:39:47,060
- Like old Jimmy down there.
- He's not the right guy.

1133
01:39:47,300 --> 01:39:49,220
He was to you.

1134
01:39:49,460 --> 01:39:52,540
Come on, you got your revenge.
Enjoy it while you still remember.

1135
01:39:52,780 --> 01:39:55,060
What difference does it make
whether he was your guy or not?

1136
01:39:55,300 --> 01:39:57,180
- It makes all the difference.
- Why? You're never gonna know.

1137
01:39:57,420 --> 01:39:58,980
- Yes, I will.
- No, you won't.

1138
01:39:59,220 --> 01:40:01,380
- Somehow I'll know.
- You won't remember!

1139
01:40:01,620 --> 01:40:02,860
When it's done, I will know.

1140
01:40:03,100 --> 01:40:07,580
I thought so, too, I was sure of it,
but you didn't!

1141
01:40:09,580 --> 01:40:14,180
That's right. The real John G.
I helped you find him over a year ago.

1142
01:40:14,420 --> 01:40:17,020
- He's already dead.
- Don't lie to me any more.

1143
01:40:17,260 --> 01:40:19,100
Look, Lenny...

1144
01:40:19,340 --> 01:40:22,260
...I was the cop assigned
to your wife's case, I believed you.

1145
01:40:22,500 --> 01:40:24,740
I thought you deserved
a chance for revenge.

1146
01:40:24,980 --> 01:40:28,060
I'm the one that helped you find
the other guy in your bathroom that night.

1147
01:40:28,300 --> 01:40:30,300
The guy that cracked your skull
and fucked your wife.

1148
01:40:30,540 --> 01:40:34,380
We found him, you killed him.

1149
01:40:34,500 --> 01:40:36,620
But you didn't remember.

1150
01:40:36,860 --> 01:40:41,660
So I helped you start looking again,
looking for the guy you already killed.

1151
01:40:41,900 --> 01:40:46,260
- Oh, yeah? So who was he?
- Just some guy. Does it matter who?

1152
01:40:46,500 --> 01:40:50,900
No reason, Lenny, no conspiracy,
just bad fucking luck.

1153
01:40:51,140 --> 01:40:56,020
Couple of junkies too strung out
to realise your wife didn't live alone.

1154
01:40:56,220 --> 01:41:00,660
But when you killed him
I was so convinced that you'd remember.

1155
01:41:00,900 --> 01:41:03,140
But it didn't stick.

1156
01:41:03,380 --> 01:41:07,020
Like nothing ever sticks,
like this won't stick.

1157
01:41:09,580 --> 01:41:11,540
I took that picture.

1158
01:41:11,780 --> 01:41:15,260
Just when you did it.

1159
01:41:16,380 --> 01:41:21,020
Look how happy you are.
I wanted to see that face again.

1160
01:41:21,260 --> 01:41:23,500
- Oh, gee, thanks(!)
- Fuck you.

1161
01:41:23,740 --> 01:41:27,460
I gave you a reason to live
and you were more than happy to help.

1162
01:41:27,700 --> 01:41:33,700
You don't want the truth. You make up
your own truth, like your police file.

1163
01:41:33,940 --> 01:41:36,740
It was complete when I gave it to you.
Who took out the twelve pages?

1164
01:41:36,980 --> 01:41:38,140
You, probably.

1165
01:41:38,380 --> 01:41:40,540
- No, it wasn't me, see, it was you.
- Why would I do that?

1166
01:41:40,780 --> 01:41:43,340
To create a puzzle you could never solve.

1167
01:41:43,580 --> 01:41:45,340
Do you know how many towns...

1168
01:41:45,580 --> 01:41:49,460
...how many John Gs or James Gs?
I mean, shit, Lenny, I'm a fucking John G.

1169
01:41:49,700 --> 01:41:52,620
- Your name's Teddy.
- My mother calls me Teddy.

1170
01:41:52,860 --> 01:41:54,660
My name's John Edward Gammell.

1171
01:41:54,900 --> 01:42:00,980
Cheer up. There's plenty of John Gs
for us to find.

1172
01:42:02,820 --> 01:42:06,860
All you do is moan! I'm the one
that has to live with what you've done.

1173
01:42:07,100 --> 01:42:08,900
I'm the one that put it all together.

1174
01:42:09,140 --> 01:42:13,460
You, you wander around, you're playing
detective. You're living a dream, kid.

1175
01:42:13,700 --> 01:42:16,420
A dead wife to pine for,
a sense of purpose to your life...

1176
01:42:16,660 --> 01:42:21,900
...a romantic quest that you wouldn't end
even if I wasn't in the picture.

1177
01:42:22,140 --> 01:42:25,020
- I should kill you.
- Quit it! Lenny, come on.

1178
01:42:25,260 --> 01:42:29,660
You're not a killer.
That's why you're so good at it.

1179
01:42:30,180 --> 01:42:31,980
Come on, what are you doing?

1180
01:42:32,220 --> 01:42:37,780
You know what time it is?
It's beer o'clock, I'm buying.

1181
01:42:37,940 --> 01:42:41,420
Fuck!

1182
01:42:48,940 --> 01:42:51,020
<i>I'm not a killer.</i>

1183
01:42:51,260 --> 01:42:56,100
<i>I'm just someone
who wanted to make things right.</i>

1184
01:42:58,700 --> 01:43:04,020
<i>Can I just let myself forget
what you've told me?</i>

1185
01:43:18,300 --> 01:43:21,780
<i>Can I just let myself forget
what you made me do?</i>

1186
01:43:35,220 --> 01:43:39,580
<i>You think I just want another puzzle
to solve? Another John G to look for?</i>

1187
01:43:39,820 --> 01:43:43,540
<i>You're a John G.</i>

1188
01:43:44,380 --> 01:43:47,900
<i>So you can be my John G.</i>

1189
01:43:54,380 --> 01:43:56,980
<i>Do I lie to myself to be happy?</i>

1190
01:43:57,220 --> 01:44:00,020
<i>In your case, Teddy...</i>

1191
01:44:00,540 --> 01:44:04,020
<i>... yes, I will.</i>

1192
01:44:14,540 --> 01:44:16,340
Hey! Hey, that's not your car!

1193
01:44:16,580 --> 01:44:19,380
- It is now.
- Jesus Christ, you can't take it!

1194
01:44:19,620 --> 01:44:21,700
- Why not?
- Because the guy you just killed owns it!

1195
01:44:21,940 --> 01:44:25,260
Somebody'll recognise it.

1196
01:44:25,500 --> 01:44:29,180
You know, I think I'd rather
be mistaken for a dead guy than a killer.

1197
01:44:29,420 --> 01:44:32,380
I might hang on to this for a while.

1198
01:44:32,620 --> 01:44:34,260
Lenny.

1199
01:44:34,500 --> 01:44:37,780
Look, don't...
Will you help me find the keys?

1200
01:44:38,020 --> 01:44:39,820
Help me find my keys!

1201
01:44:40,060 --> 01:44:42,380
Lenny!

1202
01:44:46,980 --> 01:44:49,340
Lenny!

1203
01:45:01,340 --> 01:45:04,460
<i>I have to believe in a world
outside my own mind.</i>

1204
01:45:04,700 --> 01:45:06,500
<i>I have to believe
that my actions still have meaning.</i>

1205
01:45:06,740 --> 01:45:10,020
<i>Even if I can't remember them.</i>

1206
01:45:10,260 --> 01:45:16,260
<i>I have to believe that when my eyes
are closed, the world's still here.</i>

1207
01:45:16,500 --> 01:45:20,300
<i>Do I believe the world's still here?</i>

1208
01:45:21,620 --> 01:45:24,620
<i>Is it still out there?</i>

1209
01:45:26,100 --> 01:45:29,300
<i>Yeah.</i>

1210
01:45:30,060 --> 01:45:34,220
<i>We all need memories
to remind ourselves who we are.</i>

1211
01:45:34,980 --> 01:45:38,140
<i>I'm no different.</i>

1212
01:45:48,660 --> 01:45:51,820
<i>Now, where was I?</i>

1213
01:45:59,100 --> 01:46:03,580
<i># We lay in each other's arms</i>

1214
01:46:04,580 --> 01:46:08,220
<i># But the room is just an empty space</i>

1215
01:46:08,460 --> 01:46:11,820
<i># I guess we lived it out</i>

1216
01:46:12,060 --> 01:46:15,140
<i># Something in the air</i>

1217
01:46:15,380 --> 01:46:16,740
<i># We smile too fast</i>

1218
01:46:16,980 --> 01:46:21,860
<i># Then can't think of a thing to say</i>

1219
01:46:22,220 --> 01:46:26,260
<i># Lived with the best times</i>

1220
01:46:27,260 --> 01:46:30,740
<i># Left with the worst</i>

1221
01:46:32,100 --> 01:46:37,180
<i># I've danced with you too long</i>

1222
01:46:38,180 --> 01:46:40,660
<i># Nothing left to save</i>

1223
01:46:40,900 --> 01:46:46,260
<i># There's something in the air</i>

1224
01:46:46,500 --> 01:46:50,100
<i># Something in my eye</i>

1225
01:46:50,340 --> 01:46:55,220
<i># I've danced with you too long</i>

1226
01:46:55,460 --> 01:46:57,620
<i># Yeah</i>

1227
01:46:57,860 --> 01:47:01,940
<i># Something in the air</i>

1228
01:47:02,180 --> 01:47:07,740
<i># Something in my eye</i>

1229
01:47:17,860 --> 01:47:19,860
<i># Abracadoo</i>

1230
01:47:20,100 --> 01:47:23,580
<i># I lose you</i>

1231
01:47:23,620 --> 01:47:26,180
<i># We can't avoid the clash</i>

1232
01:47:26,420 --> 01:47:29,900
<i># The big mistake</i>

1233
01:47:30,260 --> 01:47:33,980
<i># Now we're gonna pay and pay</i>

1234
01:47:34,500 --> 01:47:40,820
<i># I guess you know
# I never wanted anyone more than you</i>

1235
01:47:41,060 --> 01:47:45,300
<i># Lived all our best times</i>

1236
01:47:46,260 --> 01:47:50,260
<i># Left with the worst</i>

1237
01:47:51,140 --> 01:47:56,100
<i># I've danced with you too long</i>

1238
01:47:57,100 --> 01:47:59,460
<i># Say what you will</i>

1239
01:47:59,700 --> 01:48:06,580
<i># But there's something in the air</i>

1240
01:48:07,300 --> 01:48:09,540
<i># Something in my eye</i>

1241
01:48:09,780 --> 01:48:15,660
<i># I've danced with you too long</i>

1242
01:48:16,940 --> 01:48:20,780
<i># There's something I have to say</i>

1243
01:48:21,020 --> 01:48:25,260
<i># There's something in the air</i>

1244
01:48:25,500 --> 01:48:31,020
<i># I've danced with you too long #</i>
