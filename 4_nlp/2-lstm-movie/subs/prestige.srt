1
00:00:54,052 --> 00:00:55,361
Are you watching closely?

2
00:01:02,051 --> 00:01:06,242
Every magic trick
consists of three parts or acts.

3
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:09,630
The first part is called the Pledge.

4
00:01:09,795 --> 00:01:12,894
The magician shows you
something ordinary...

5
00:01:13,059 --> 00:01:16,256
...a deck of cards, a bird, or a man.

6
00:01:22,595 --> 00:01:24,929
He shows you this object...

7
00:01:25,091 --> 00:01:27,001
...perhaps he asks you to inspect it...

8
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,652
...to see that it is, indeed, real.

9
00:01:30,819 --> 00:01:33,819
Yeah, unaltered, normal.

10
00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:39,779
But of course, it probably isn"t.

11
00:01:40,228 --> 00:01:43,872
- Where do you think you're going?
- I'm part of the bloody act, you fool.

12
00:01:56,291 --> 00:01:58,658
The second act is called the Turn.

13
00:02:12,547 --> 00:02:15,394
The magician takes
the ordinary something...

14
00:02:17,251 --> 00:02:20,000
...and makes it
do something extraordinary.

15
00:02:24,547 --> 00:02:28,027
Now, you"re looking for the secret,
but you won"t find it...

16
00:02:28,195 --> 00:02:31,359
...because, of course,
you"re not really looking.

17
00:02:31,971 --> 00:02:33,532
You don"t really wanna know.

18
00:02:36,643 --> 00:02:38,911
You want to be fooled.

19
00:02:40,707 --> 00:02:42,398
But you wouldn"t clap yet...

20
00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:46,967
...because making something disappear
isn"t enough.

21
00:02:47,555 --> 00:02:50,751
You have to bring it back.

22
00:02:52,002 --> 00:02:55,547
That"s why every magic trick
has a third act.

23
00:02:55,715 --> 00:02:57,209
The hardest part.

24
00:02:57,761 --> 00:03:01,057
The part we call the Prestige.

25
00:03:11,395 --> 00:03:15,356
The Prestige. And did Robert Angier,
the Great Danton, your employer...

26
00:03:15,522 --> 00:03:18,043
...get to that final part
of his trick that night?

27
00:03:18,211 --> 00:03:19,804
- No, sir. Something went wrong.
- What went wrong?

28
00:03:21,059 --> 00:03:24,407
I saw someone
making their way below stage.

29
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,236
I followed him.

30
00:03:26,402 --> 00:03:29,501
It was Borden,
watching Mr. Angier drown.

31
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:32,765
Would you please describe
your occupation to the jury, Mr. Cutter?

32
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:33,978
I'm an ingenieur.

33
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:38,337
I design illusions and construct the
apparatus necessary for performing them.

34
00:03:38,498 --> 00:03:39,446
So, Mr. Cutter...

35
00:03:39,618 --> 00:03:42,651
...was this water-filled tank
beneath the stage...

36
00:03:42,819 --> 00:03:44,510
...part of Mr. Angier's illusion?

37
00:03:44,675 --> 00:03:45,755
No, no. It was...

38
00:03:45,922 --> 00:03:49,883
The tank was brought on for the first trick
and then taken off-stage.

39
00:03:50,051 --> 00:03:53,117
Borden must have placed it
under the trap door after the interval.

40
00:03:53,283 --> 00:03:54,624
How large was this tank?

41
00:03:54,786 --> 00:03:59,195
Oh, it's a normal tank for escape
underwater, about 4 or 500 gallons.

42
00:03:59,363 --> 00:04:00,672
How do you think Mr. Borden...

43
00:04:00,834 --> 00:04:04,151
...was able to move the tank under
the trap door without anyone noticing?

44
00:04:04,322 --> 00:04:06,014
He's a magician. Ask him.

45
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:10,553
I ask again that this man explain
the mechanics of Mr. Angier's illusion.

46
00:04:10,723 --> 00:04:12,150
The Real Transported Man...

47
00:04:12,322 --> 00:04:15,170
...is one of the most sought-after illusions
in this business.

48
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:16,759
I have the right to sell it on.

49
00:04:16,931 --> 00:04:19,418
If I reveal the method here,
then the trick is worthless.

50
00:04:19,586 --> 00:04:23,448
How can we know that the tank wasn't
some part of the trick that went wrong?

51
00:04:24,226 --> 00:04:26,169
Mr. Cutter, I see your predicament...

52
00:04:26,338 --> 00:04:28,510
...but Alfred Borden's life
hangs in the balance.

53
00:04:28,867 --> 00:04:31,681
If you were prepared to disclose
the details to me in private...

54
00:04:31,842 --> 00:04:34,297
...I might be able to judge
their relevance to the case.

55
00:04:34,468 --> 00:04:36,955
Might this be an acceptable compromise?

56
00:04:54,658 --> 00:04:57,658
I'm gonna have to ask you
to turn out your pockets.

57
00:05:01,923 --> 00:05:03,002
Not my idea, sir.

58
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:07,000
The warden saw his show in Manchester
last year where he vanished into thin air.

59
00:05:07,171 --> 00:05:10,016
He's convinced he'll try and escape.

60
00:05:12,898 --> 00:05:15,451
I told him the only way
that Borden's gonna disappear...

61
00:05:15,619 --> 00:05:18,651
...is if I leave him out there
with the other inmates.

62
00:05:23,554 --> 00:05:24,732
Check the locks.

63
00:05:26,498 --> 00:05:28,408
Twice.

64
00:05:34,721 --> 00:05:37,088
My name is owens.

65
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,356
I'm a solicitor.

66
00:05:39,522 --> 00:05:43,003
I represent Lord caldlow, an accomplished
amateur magician and historian...

67
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:44,827
How much?

68
00:05:45,505 --> 00:05:47,873
- Lord caldlow is interested...
- How much for my tricks?

69
00:05:48,033 --> 00:05:49,276
Five thousand pounds.

70
00:05:49,443 --> 00:05:51,831
Talk with Fallon, my ingenieur.
Money's for him.

71
00:05:52,001 --> 00:05:55,482
Yes, I did.
He offered to sell me your tricks.

72
00:05:55,649 --> 00:05:58,268
All except the most valuable one:
The Transported Man.

73
00:05:58,434 --> 00:06:01,467
Well, I wouldn't forgive myself
for selling my greatest trick.

74
00:06:01,633 --> 00:06:02,878
Even for your daughter?

75
00:06:04,642 --> 00:06:07,063
If the newspapers are right
and you are for the drop...

76
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:10,462
...your daughter will need looking after.
- Fallon will take care of her.

77
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:13,887
Bernard Fallon? A man with a past
almost as obscure as your own.

78
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:16,571
Courts motioned that the girl
be removed from his care.

79
00:06:16,737 --> 00:06:19,071
No, the girl will be an orphan.

80
00:06:19,682 --> 00:06:23,904
I know you're no stranger to the workhouse.
It's better than here?

81
00:06:24,066 --> 00:06:26,968
I'm offering you a way
to wrap up your affairs with dignity.

82
00:06:27,138 --> 00:06:28,927
And I'm offering your daughter a future.

83
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:32,570
As Lord caldlow's ward,
she will want for nothing. Ever.

84
00:06:34,113 --> 00:06:36,502
Well, think it over.

85
00:06:37,282 --> 00:06:41,438
And Lord caldlow would like you
to have this as a show of good faith.

86
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:44,830
He said it might be of interest.
This is Robert Angier's diary.

87
00:06:44,993 --> 00:06:47,612
Including the time he spent
in colorado learning your trick.

88
00:06:47,778 --> 00:06:49,272
- He never learned my trick.
- Really?

89
00:06:49,441 --> 00:06:52,757
On his return from colorado, he mounted
a version of The Transported Man...

90
00:06:52,928 --> 00:06:56,606
...that the papers said
was better even than your original.

91
00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:02,912
If you want Angier's secrets,
you go dig him up and ask him yourself.

92
00:07:03,393 --> 00:07:05,881
I want your secret, Mr. Borden.

93
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:09,242
Consider your daughter.

94
00:07:16,578 --> 00:07:20,351
A cipher. An enigma.

95
00:07:22,146 --> 00:07:25,342
A search. A search for answers.

96
00:07:32,289 --> 00:07:35,933
Even if Colorado
is the end of my journey...

97
00:07:36,096 --> 00:07:41,564
...it"ll take much longer to unravel
the rest of Borden"s secrets.

98
00:07:43,105 --> 00:07:47,480
See, the cipher in his notebook
is unlocked by a single word...

99
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:53,213
...but it will still take months to translate
his writing and to know his mind.

100
00:07:55,906 --> 00:07:59,135
Well, my passion is equal to the task.

101
00:08:10,688 --> 00:08:14,334
Mr. Angier?
Welcome to colorado Springs.

102
00:08:28,769 --> 00:08:32,183
- The whole town has electricity.
- Yes, sir.

103
00:08:48,225 --> 00:08:51,094
Well, quite a reception.

104
00:08:51,265 --> 00:08:53,533
You're our first guest of the season,
Mr. Angier.

105
00:08:53,697 --> 00:08:56,926
Your telegram didn't indicate
how long you'll be staying with us.

106
00:08:57,088 --> 00:08:58,551
For as long as it takes.

107
00:08:58,721 --> 00:09:01,753
I'll need a coach tomorrow
to take me up the mountain.

108
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,303
Well, the peak is closed, sir,
for scientific experimentation.

109
00:09:05,473 --> 00:09:08,572
Yes, I know. That's why I'm here.

110
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,589
You'll have to walk the rest,
I'm afraid, sir.

111
00:09:56,257 --> 00:10:01,789
I'm amazed how many of you
newspaper writers can't read my sign.

112
00:10:06,497 --> 00:10:08,405
Not the welcome I was expecting.

113
00:10:11,648 --> 00:10:13,208
I know you.

114
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:21,402
You're the Great Danton.
I saw your show in London seven times.

115
00:10:21,569 --> 00:10:25,692
You guessed every object
the audience had in their pockets.

116
00:10:25,856 --> 00:10:27,165
I'm Alley.

117
00:10:27,329 --> 00:10:29,696
Sorry about the fence.
People interfere with our work.

118
00:10:29,856 --> 00:10:32,279
- I've come to see Tesla.
- Why?

119
00:10:32,449 --> 00:10:36,158
He made a machine
for a colleague of mine sometime ago.

120
00:10:36,321 --> 00:10:39,669
- Can you get me a meeting with him?
- Impossible, I'm afraid.

121
00:10:39,841 --> 00:10:41,913
I brought a lot of money.

122
00:10:42,081 --> 00:10:43,542
I'm sorry, Mr. Angier.

123
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,418
I simply can't help you.

124
00:10:48,353 --> 00:10:51,702
I'll be staying at the hotel. Indefinitely.

125
00:10:54,465 --> 00:10:55,610
Hey, what am I holding?

126
00:10:56,449 --> 00:10:57,693
Your watch.

127
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:07,775
Borden"s journal entry for April 3rd, 1897,
describes a show at the Orpheum Theater.

128
00:11:07,936 --> 00:11:11,613
That was just days after he first met me.

129
00:11:13,504 --> 00:11:16,439
We were two young men
at the start of a great career.

130
00:11:16,608 --> 00:11:19,030
Two young men devoted to an illusion.

131
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,272
Two young men
who never intended to hurt anyone.

132
00:11:21,441 --> 00:11:25,717
Which of you brave souls is willing
to bind this lovely young woman?

133
00:11:37,536 --> 00:11:38,844
If you would tie her wrists.

134
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:44,253
Bind her feet around the ankle.

135
00:11:44,417 --> 00:11:46,325
Are either of you two gentlemen sailors?

136
00:11:46,496 --> 00:11:48,122
- No.
- No.

137
00:11:48,991 --> 00:11:52,252
I'm sure you can both tie a strong knot.

138
00:12:52,735 --> 00:12:55,899
He's complacent,
he's predictable, he's boring.

139
00:12:56,064 --> 00:12:58,551
I mean, Milton has gotten success,
whatever that means...

140
00:12:58,719 --> 00:13:01,371
...and now he's scared.
He won't take any risks at all.

141
00:13:01,536 --> 00:13:04,154
I mean, he's squandering
the goodwill of the audience...

142
00:13:04,319 --> 00:13:07,134
...with tired, second-rate tricks.
- They're old favorites.

143
00:13:07,296 --> 00:13:10,524
Favorites? Give me something fresh.
He won't even try a bullet catch.

144
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:12,214
A bullet catch is suicide.

145
00:13:12,384 --> 00:13:16,125
All it takes is some smart-ass volunteer
to put a button in the barrel.

146
00:13:16,288 --> 00:13:18,556
- Fine. Use a plant.
- You can't for every trick.

147
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,403
- There'd be no seats left for the punters.
- No bullet catch.

148
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:25,757
Whatever. The point is that a real magician
tries to invent something new...

149
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:28,569
...that other magicians
are gonna scratch their heads over.

150
00:13:28,735 --> 00:13:30,808
And then you sell it to him
for a small fortune.

151
00:13:30,975 --> 00:13:31,923
- All right.
- Yeah.

152
00:13:32,096 --> 00:13:33,852
I suppose you have such a trick.

153
00:13:34,016 --> 00:13:36,349
- Actually, I do.
- Would you care to sell it to me?

154
00:13:36,511 --> 00:13:37,972
No.
No one else could do my trick.

155
00:13:38,143 --> 00:13:40,085
- Any trick can be duplicated, right?
- Wrong.

156
00:13:40,254 --> 00:13:43,037
If Mr. Borden
has invented his masterpiece...

157
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,271
...it might be only he's prepared to do it.

158
00:13:45,631 --> 00:13:47,704
Milton is a great showman,
but Borden is right.

159
00:13:47,872 --> 00:13:49,366
He won't get his hands dirty.

160
00:13:49,792 --> 00:13:53,752
If you wanna see what it takes
to make real magic, go to the Tenley.

161
00:13:53,918 --> 00:13:56,505
There's a chinaman there,
and he really has what it takes.

162
00:13:56,671 --> 00:13:58,810
- Chung Ling Soo.
- Pricey. I can't afford that.

163
00:13:58,975 --> 00:14:00,470
I know the bloke on the door.

164
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,843
You two go and see that show...

165
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,829
...and whichever one of you
can tell me...

166
00:14:04,991 --> 00:14:06,780
...how he does
the goldfish-bowl trick...

167
00:14:06,942 --> 00:14:08,186
...gets a prize.
- All right.

168
00:14:08,351 --> 00:14:09,944
- Which is?
- Ten minutes on-stage...

169
00:14:10,111 --> 00:14:11,834
...with my old friend Mr. Ackerman.

170
00:14:11,999 --> 00:14:13,276
- Really?
- Who's Ackerman?

171
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,446
The top theatrical agent in London.

172
00:14:16,864 --> 00:14:18,424
I saw you drop the knot again.

173
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:21,788
- I think I turned my wrist.
- Some nights, you just don't get it, do you?

174
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:25,747
I mean, if that knot slips
and Julia's on the hoist, she'll break a leg.

175
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:30,076
It's the wrong knot. Like I said,
the Langford double will hold tighter.

176
00:14:30,238 --> 00:14:33,687
The Langford double isn't a wet knot.
It's too dangerous.

177
00:14:33,855 --> 00:14:35,863
If the rope swells up, she won't slip it.

178
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:39,031
- I can slip a Langford underwater.
- She can slip it. We'll practice.

179
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:40,476
Hey, Borden, he said no.

180
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,875
Yeah, well, you know knots
better than me, do you?

181
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:44,862
Listen, no more mistakes.

182
00:14:45,312 --> 00:14:47,515
All right. Yeah, do you?
You wanna take over?

183
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:50,363
- Just leave it.
- I didn't think so.

184
00:14:54,655 --> 00:14:57,143
- Hey, cutter, where's he from?
- Where are you from?

185
00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:01,401
- He shifts props for virgil at the hall.
- Aren't you worried he'll steal your tricks?

186
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,770
- He doesn't deal in methods.
- How do you know?

187
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:08,822
Because I hired him to find out
how virgil does the orange trick.

188
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:11,227
- Well, I don't trust him.
- He's a natural magician.

189
00:15:11,391 --> 00:15:12,765
Of course you can't trust him.

190
00:15:13,568 --> 00:15:14,582
I think he's all right.

191
00:15:14,751 --> 00:15:16,988
- You think everyone's all right.
- Even you.

192
00:15:17,151 --> 00:15:20,697
Watch your sightlines. If I can see you
kissing your wife's leg every night...

193
00:15:20,863 --> 00:15:23,284
...so can the blokes
at the ends of row three and four.

194
00:15:54,591 --> 00:15:56,446
- You"re wrong. It can"t be.
- No, it is.

195
00:15:56,607 --> 00:15:59,924
- Look at the man.
- This is the trick.

196
00:16:00,096 --> 00:16:04,438
This is a performance right here.
This is why no one can detect his method.

197
00:16:06,269 --> 00:16:07,678
Total devotion to his art.

198
00:16:08,702 --> 00:16:12,631
Utter self-sacrifice, you know?

199
00:16:12,798 --> 00:16:18,166
It's the only way to escape all this,
you know.

200
00:16:20,255 --> 00:16:21,204
All right.

201
00:16:21,376 --> 00:16:25,150
I can barely lift this thing
and it's not even filled with water.

202
00:16:26,462 --> 00:16:28,667
Or fish. Look.

203
00:16:28,831 --> 00:16:30,871
I don't know. Hang on a second.

204
00:16:33,247 --> 00:16:35,767
He must be strong as an ox.

205
00:16:38,015 --> 00:16:40,665
He's been pretending
to be a cripple for years.

206
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:44,125
Any time he's in public. Any time
he goes out. It's unthinkable.

207
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:47,134
Borden saw it at once,
but I couldn't fathom it.

208
00:16:47,295 --> 00:16:49,783
Living my whole life
pretending to be someone else.

209
00:16:49,951 --> 00:16:53,464
- You're pretending to be someone else.
- I don't think changing a name compares.

210
00:16:53,631 --> 00:16:55,997
Not just your name.
Who you are and where you're from.

211
00:16:56,159 --> 00:17:00,217
I promised my family I wouldn't embarrass
them with my theatrical endeavors.

212
00:17:01,407 --> 00:17:03,478
I thought of a name for you.

213
00:17:04,862 --> 00:17:06,749
The Great Danton.

214
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:09,266
Do you like it?

215
00:17:10,334 --> 00:17:12,473
- But it's sophisticated.
- It's French.

216
00:17:18,878 --> 00:17:22,194
Borden writes as if no one but he
understood the true nature of magic.

217
00:17:27,773 --> 00:17:30,556
But what does he know of self-sacrifice?

218
00:17:35,197 --> 00:17:37,270
You bloody fool.

219
00:18:03,678 --> 00:18:06,012
- He killed it.
- What?

220
00:18:06,173 --> 00:18:07,122
What's wrong?

221
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:11,156
- He killed it.
- I'm sure he didn't.

222
00:18:14,845 --> 00:18:16,373
See? Look, now
he'll bring it back.

223
00:18:18,621 --> 00:18:21,273
No, he killed it.

224
00:18:22,526 --> 00:18:23,508
No.

225
00:18:29,405 --> 00:18:32,156
Look. See?
He's all right. He's fine.

226
00:18:32,317 --> 00:18:36,147
- Look at him.
- But where's his brother?

227
00:18:38,942 --> 00:18:41,811
He's a sharp lad, your son.

228
00:18:41,982 --> 00:18:44,437
Oh, he's my nephew.

229
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:51,453
You're the lucky one today.

230
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:13,401
Are you watching closely?

231
00:19:17,021 --> 00:19:18,395
Look closer.

232
00:19:21,343 --> 00:19:23,000
Never show anyone.

233
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:27,611
They'll beg you and they'll flatter you for
the secret, but as soon as you give it up...

234
00:19:27,774 --> 00:19:29,179
...you'll be nothing to them.

235
00:19:29,341 --> 00:19:31,447
You understand? Nothing.

236
00:19:31,613 --> 00:19:34,363
The secret impresses no one.

237
00:19:34,526 --> 00:19:37,875
The trick you use it for is everything.

238
00:19:42,205 --> 00:19:46,330
- Well, thank you for lunch, Mr. Borden.
- You're welcome.

239
00:19:47,774 --> 00:19:50,840
- Alfred. It's Alfred.
- Alfred.

240
00:19:51,006 --> 00:19:53,755
So I could use a cup of tea.

241
00:19:53,917 --> 00:19:58,074
I'd scandalize the landlord. I think not.

242
00:19:58,717 --> 00:20:01,531
You think that's...?
Is that enough to keep me out?

243
00:20:03,678 --> 00:20:04,790
I think so.

244
00:20:05,885 --> 00:20:07,447
So I'll see you again?

245
00:20:16,284 --> 00:20:17,659
Milk and sugar?

246
00:20:38,909 --> 00:20:42,651
- What's in there?
- Angier's machine.

247
00:20:51,004 --> 00:20:52,380
You built this, Mr. Cutter?

248
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:55,224
Oh, no, sir.
This wasn't built by a magician.

249
00:20:55,388 --> 00:20:57,244
This was built by a wizard.

250
00:20:57,405 --> 00:21:01,845
A man who can actually do
what magicians pretend to do.

251
00:21:02,012 --> 00:21:06,203
Tell me, Your Honor, what happens
with these things after the trial?

252
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:08,023
They've been sold to a Lord caldlow.

253
00:21:08,189 --> 00:21:10,872
An avid collector,
apparently very interested in the case.

254
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:13,371
Yeah, well, don't let him take this.

255
00:21:13,531 --> 00:21:15,223
- Why ever not?
- It's too dangerous.

256
00:21:16,157 --> 00:21:20,564
I'm sure beneath its bells and whistles
it's got a simple and disappointing trick.

257
00:21:20,733 --> 00:21:23,515
Most disappointing of all, sir...

258
00:21:24,957 --> 00:21:26,900
...it has no trick.

259
00:21:29,117 --> 00:21:30,490
It's real.

260
00:21:33,565 --> 00:21:35,671
This is the tank Angier drowned in?

261
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:37,719
Yes.

262
00:21:37,885 --> 00:21:43,995
This is the place where the performer's
hand reaches through to the trick padlock.

263
00:21:44,156 --> 00:21:46,393
A standard magical apparatus
for escapes.

264
00:21:46,557 --> 00:21:48,826
Yeah, with one important difference:

265
00:21:48,988 --> 00:21:50,810
This isn't a trick lock.

266
00:21:50,973 --> 00:21:52,826
It's been switched for a real one.

267
00:21:52,989 --> 00:21:54,811
What a way to kill someone.

268
00:21:55,357 --> 00:21:58,652
They're magicians, Your Honor.
Showmen.

269
00:21:58,812 --> 00:22:02,674
Men who live by dressing up plain
and sometimes-brutal truths...

270
00:22:03,195 --> 00:22:05,618
...to amaze, to shock.

271
00:22:05,789 --> 00:22:08,058
Even without an audience?

272
00:22:09,117 --> 00:22:10,839
There was an audience.

273
00:22:11,709 --> 00:22:13,715
You see, this water tank...

274
00:22:13,885 --> 00:22:17,910
...was of particular significance
to these two men.

275
00:22:18,334 --> 00:22:20,853
Particularly awful significance.

276
00:22:23,485 --> 00:22:28,273
Which of you brave souls is willing
to bind this lovely young woman?

277
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,028
If you would tie her wrists.

278
00:22:32,187 --> 00:22:34,260
Bind her feet around the ankle.

279
00:22:47,133 --> 00:22:48,921
Are either of you two gentlemen sailors?

280
00:22:49,083 --> 00:22:50,066
No.

281
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:54,266
I'm sure you can both tie a strong knot.

282
00:23:46,523 --> 00:23:47,507
Robert!

283
00:24:06,972 --> 00:24:09,460
No! No! No!

284
00:24:12,252 --> 00:24:13,910
Julia. Julia.

285
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:16,411
Julia! Julia!

286
00:24:59,324 --> 00:25:01,941
I knew an old sailor once.

287
00:25:02,107 --> 00:25:06,897
He told me he went overboard,
tangled in the sails.

288
00:25:07,067 --> 00:25:12,468
They pulled him out,
but it took him five minutes to cough.

289
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:16,410
He said it was like going home.

290
00:25:21,596 --> 00:25:23,701
What do you want, Borden?

291
00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:32,187
I'm sorry for your loss, Angier.

292
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,105
Which knot did you tie?

293
00:25:40,859 --> 00:25:42,321
I keep asking myself that.

294
00:25:43,771 --> 00:25:46,390
- And?
- And...

295
00:25:47,515 --> 00:25:50,069
I'm sorry, I just don't know.

296
00:25:52,123 --> 00:25:53,530
You don't know?

297
00:25:54,939 --> 00:25:56,882
I'm sorry.

298
00:25:58,108 --> 00:25:59,864
You don't know?

299
00:26:04,092 --> 00:26:06,066
You don't know?

300
00:26:12,283 --> 00:26:13,363
Alfred?

301
00:26:13,532 --> 00:26:15,736
Good news.
We got our first booking today.

302
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:18,747
- I don't think we've had the pleasure.
- Mr. Fallon is my ingenieur.

303
00:26:18,907 --> 00:26:22,223
- Where did you get all of...?
- Begged, borrowed, and don't ask.

304
00:26:22,395 --> 00:26:26,323
He's a very enterprising soul,
is Mr. Fallon.

305
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:27,898
- So...
- we can't afford to pay him.

306
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:29,782
Money will come
when we get the audience.

307
00:26:29,948 --> 00:26:33,264
But what about until then? I mean,
what I earn, it's barely enough for us.

308
00:26:33,435 --> 00:26:36,435
Don't worry about it. I'll share
half my food with him or something.

309
00:26:37,371 --> 00:26:40,089
You're already going to be doing that
with someone else.

310
00:26:40,412 --> 00:26:44,187
- No. You're...?
- Having a baby.

311
00:26:44,827 --> 00:26:47,957
Oh, my God. We should have told Fallon.

312
00:26:48,123 --> 00:26:49,847
That is great. We're having a baby.

313
00:26:50,011 --> 00:26:51,954
- We're having a baby.
- Oh, come here.

314
00:26:55,483 --> 00:26:56,728
Alfred, what's this?

315
00:26:56,892 --> 00:27:00,754
Oh, this is just the trick to wake
Ackerman up at the end of my act.

316
00:27:00,924 --> 00:27:03,443
Is it the masterpiece? The great trick?

317
00:27:03,612 --> 00:27:06,067
No, no, no. The world is not ready
for that one yet.

318
00:27:06,236 --> 00:27:10,359
This is just your run-of-the-mill,
daring, spectacular bullet catch.

319
00:27:10,972 --> 00:27:15,128
- A bullet catch?
- Yeah, but it's safe, I promise. Look.

320
00:27:17,531 --> 00:27:19,604
- Shoot me.
- Shoot you?

321
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:20,786
Go on, shoot me.

322
00:27:23,195 --> 00:27:25,203
- Right there.
- No, I can't.

323
00:27:25,371 --> 00:27:28,120
No, no, not there. Shoot me here. Don't...

324
00:27:32,476 --> 00:27:36,119
- How's that?
- That's very good.

325
00:27:36,283 --> 00:27:38,868
- Go on, tell me how you do it.
- No, I can't do that.

326
00:27:41,052 --> 00:27:43,735
- Well, then you can't do it. Alfred...
- I can't do it?

327
00:27:43,898 --> 00:27:46,965
I'm sorry, Alfred,
but I can't raise a child on my own.

328
00:27:47,578 --> 00:27:50,677
- You don't tell anybody that I told you.
- Okay.

329
00:27:50,843 --> 00:27:52,500
Gunpowder...

330
00:27:54,107 --> 00:27:55,055
...wadding...

331
00:27:56,763 --> 00:27:58,421
...and a bullet.

332
00:27:59,322 --> 00:28:00,731
A ramrod.

333
00:28:05,467 --> 00:28:06,414
Hold out your hand.

334
00:28:09,434 --> 00:28:13,112
The bullet is not even in the gun
when the charge is fired.

335
00:28:13,402 --> 00:28:16,751
Once you know,
it's actually very obvious.

336
00:28:17,914 --> 00:28:19,704
Well, I mean, you still get...

337
00:28:19,866 --> 00:28:22,681
It's dangerous. I mean,
people still get killed doing that.

338
00:28:22,842 --> 00:28:24,019
- Well, how?
- Well, you know.

339
00:28:24,187 --> 00:28:27,035
Somebody could get a smart-ass.
He can put a penny or a button...

340
00:28:27,195 --> 00:28:30,009
...or may God forbid, Sarah,
somebody could put a bullet there.

341
00:28:30,171 --> 00:28:32,504
Don't worry. Don't worry...

342
00:28:32,666 --> 00:28:35,798
...because I'm not gonna let
anything happen.

343
00:28:35,962 --> 00:28:37,490
Everything's gonna be all right...

344
00:28:37,658 --> 00:28:43,573
...because I love you very much.

345
00:28:45,689 --> 00:28:48,756
- Say it again.
- I love you.

346
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:52,120
- Not today.
- What?

347
00:28:52,283 --> 00:28:55,283
Well, on some days it's not true,
and today you don't mean it.

348
00:28:55,451 --> 00:28:58,418
Maybe today you're more
in love with magic than me.

349
00:28:58,586 --> 00:29:00,823
I like being able to tell the difference.

350
00:29:00,985 --> 00:29:05,688
It makes the days it is true
mean something.

351
00:29:07,802 --> 00:29:09,297
All right.

352
00:29:27,546 --> 00:29:30,362
Metal rings, ladies and gentlemen.

353
00:29:30,523 --> 00:29:33,206
If there are any
ladies or gentlemen here.

354
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:36,404
- Solid metal.
- Seen that already.

355
00:29:36,569 --> 00:29:39,352
- Leave it out!
- Come on.

356
00:29:43,162 --> 00:29:45,945
Get out your gun, mate.

357
00:29:46,651 --> 00:29:48,560
- Who threw that?
- I did!

358
00:29:53,882 --> 00:29:56,817
Get out your gun.
You're gonna need it.

359
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:02,035
Get a gun.

360
00:30:03,579 --> 00:30:05,783
It's what you came for, is it?

361
00:30:08,954 --> 00:30:12,915
So who wants to volunteer?

362
00:30:13,403 --> 00:30:15,822
Me! Me!

363
00:30:25,337 --> 00:30:26,712
Me.

364
00:30:27,738 --> 00:30:29,146
Watch it, cowboy.

365
00:30:40,058 --> 00:30:42,327
Are you man enough, sir?

366
00:30:47,226 --> 00:30:48,721
Yes.

367
00:30:59,354 --> 00:31:01,209
Which knot did you tie, Borden?

368
00:31:07,226 --> 00:31:09,298
Which knot did you tie, Borden?

369
00:31:10,552 --> 00:31:12,080
I don't know.

370
00:31:27,065 --> 00:31:30,513
He came in to demand an answer,
and I told him the truth.

371
00:31:30,682 --> 00:31:33,551
That I have fought with myself
over that night.

372
00:31:33,723 --> 00:31:37,038
One half of me swearing blind
that I tied a simple slipknot...

373
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:40,308
...the other half convinced
that I tied the Langford double.

374
00:31:40,474 --> 00:31:42,579
I can never know for sure.

375
00:31:45,049 --> 00:31:47,154
How can he not know?

376
00:31:47,321 --> 00:31:49,558
How can he not know?

377
00:31:50,586 --> 00:31:54,328
He must know what he did. He must.

378
00:31:56,954 --> 00:31:58,808
Sarah, that bloody hurts.

379
00:31:59,899 --> 00:32:02,003
I don't understand
how it can be bleeding again.

380
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,407
It's as bad as the day it happened.

381
00:32:06,168 --> 00:32:11,156
- We have to get a doctor back.
- We can't afford the bloody doctor back.

382
00:32:11,321 --> 00:32:13,971
- You've woken her.
- Great.

383
00:32:14,906 --> 00:32:17,426
I'm sorry. I need this to heal
so I can go back to work.

384
00:32:17,593 --> 00:32:21,138
Alfred, face things. What tricks
can you perform with this kind of injury?

385
00:32:21,307 --> 00:32:24,654
I can do card pulls.
I can do some prop tricks.

386
00:32:24,825 --> 00:32:28,950
I can still do that. And I can do the trick
that I've been telling you about.

387
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:31,022
The one that they're gonna
remember me for.

388
00:32:33,401 --> 00:32:35,124
Come on.

389
00:32:59,897 --> 00:33:02,483
Never thought I'd find an answer
at the bottom of a glass.

390
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:04,111
Hasn't stopped you looking.

391
00:33:09,145 --> 00:33:10,322
Heard about a booking.

392
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:13,969
Nice little theater.
Young up-and-coming magician.

393
00:33:14,137 --> 00:33:15,478
- Who?
- You.

394
00:33:15,641 --> 00:33:17,265
You got me a booking? Why?

395
00:33:17,432 --> 00:33:19,256
I wanna keep on working.

396
00:33:19,418 --> 00:33:22,320
And who's gonna hire the ingenieur
that killed Julia Mccullough...

397
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:24,628
...in front of a sellout crowd
at the orpheum?

398
00:33:25,433 --> 00:33:27,506
Someone who knows
it wasn't your fault.

399
00:33:27,673 --> 00:33:30,902
Someone who knows Alfred Borden
and his repertoire of exotic knots.

400
00:33:31,065 --> 00:33:34,381
I hear he had a spot of bad luck
catching a bullet south of the river.

401
00:33:34,552 --> 00:33:36,855
That's a dangerous trick, that one.

402
00:33:42,329 --> 00:33:44,021
We'll have to whitewash the windows...

403
00:33:44,185 --> 00:33:48,408
...confound the more curious members
of the public, but it will do.

404
00:33:49,977 --> 00:33:52,792
- We should see about an assistant.
- I've made some arrangements.

405
00:33:53,817 --> 00:33:56,207
Have you settled on a name?

406
00:33:56,377 --> 00:33:59,672
Yes, I have. The Great Danton.

407
00:33:59,832 --> 00:34:02,200
It's a bit old-fashioned, isn't it?

408
00:34:03,673 --> 00:34:05,713
No, it's sophisticated.

409
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,215
The birdcage can't be our climax.
Everybody knows it.

410
00:34:08,378 --> 00:34:10,798
- Not like this they don't.
- I don't wanna kill doves.

411
00:34:10,968 --> 00:34:14,351
Then stay off the stage.
You're a magician, not a wizard.

412
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:18,231
You gotta get your hands dirty
if you're gonna achieve the impossible.

413
00:34:19,608 --> 00:34:21,844
In here, Miss wenscombe.

414
00:34:22,008 --> 00:34:25,237
No point in you meeting Mr. Angier
if you don't fit.

415
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,288
On the right.

416
00:34:29,241 --> 00:34:30,420
What's so hard about this?

417
00:34:30,585 --> 00:34:33,684
Nothing. But you're going down here.

418
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:39,160
Hold it. Hold it there.
This has gotta go around there.

419
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,328
- And this will conceal it?
- Yeah, oh, sure.

420
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:42,544
- All right?
- Yeah.

421
00:34:42,712 --> 00:34:45,200
- Now, take that one there.
- Yep. Okay.

422
00:34:45,368 --> 00:34:47,736
- Pin this under.
- And this ties up here?

423
00:34:47,897 --> 00:34:49,620
- That ties at the front.
- That's good.

424
00:34:55,577 --> 00:34:58,227
Breathe as little as possible.

425
00:35:03,705 --> 00:35:06,357
Now, you see? That'll go. That'll flatten.

426
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:07,764
- I see. Yeah.
- Okay.

427
00:35:11,097 --> 00:35:14,870
She's not experienced,
but she knows how to present herself.

428
00:35:15,032 --> 00:35:19,090
A pretty assistant is the most
effective form of misdirection.

429
00:35:19,608 --> 00:35:20,558
Thank you.

430
00:35:20,729 --> 00:35:22,637
Ladies and gentlemen,
for my final trick...

431
00:35:22,808 --> 00:35:25,361
...I will require the assistance
of two volunteers.

432
00:35:25,528 --> 00:35:27,765
Mr. Merrit, if you would oblige me?

433
00:35:29,496 --> 00:35:32,530
Yeah. Okay. Bring your hand around.

434
00:35:32,889 --> 00:35:34,230
- Under?
- Under, yeah.

435
00:35:34,938 --> 00:35:37,042
There. I put it around its foot.

436
00:35:37,208 --> 00:35:38,965
- Careful.
- He's all right, ain't he?

437
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:01,237
- You get a volunteer to put a hand there.
- Yeah.

438
00:36:01,401 --> 00:36:02,415
And another one there.

439
00:36:02,584 --> 00:36:06,097
Mr. Merrit, if you'll place your hands
on either side of the cage, please.

440
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:07,212
Thank you, olivia.

441
00:36:07,384 --> 00:36:09,107
You best not be intending...

442
00:36:09,271 --> 00:36:11,639
...to hurt this animal, Mr. Angier.
- Of course not.

443
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,940
You ready? All right.

444
00:36:14,104 --> 00:36:15,598
One...

445
00:36:15,767 --> 00:36:17,197
Two...

446
00:36:17,432 --> 00:36:19,504
- Three.
- Three. Go.

447
00:36:22,488 --> 00:36:24,146
Well, that's bloody marvelous,
cutter.

448
00:36:25,305 --> 00:36:26,253
Very nice.

449
00:36:26,424 --> 00:36:28,464
And the best part is...

450
00:36:33,528 --> 00:36:35,568
I thought you said
I had to get my hands dirty.

451
00:36:35,736 --> 00:36:38,998
Someday perhaps you will.
I just had to know that you can.

452
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,777
- Very nice. Very nice, indeed.
- Thank you, Mr. Merrit.

453
00:36:41,943 --> 00:36:44,660
I haven't had the chance
to compliment your beautiful theater.

454
00:36:44,823 --> 00:36:47,060
Well, it'll be a lot more beautiful
when it's full.

455
00:36:47,224 --> 00:36:48,980
- Don't worry.
- Oh, you all say that.

456
00:36:49,145 --> 00:36:52,789
Why should I worry? If your tricks
don't get them in, somebody else's will.

457
00:36:52,951 --> 00:36:56,945
Maybe somebody willing to do
a bullet catch or a water escape?

458
00:36:57,112 --> 00:36:58,421
Cheap thrills, Mr. Merrit.

459
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:02,065
People hoping for an accident,
likely to see one too.

460
00:37:02,232 --> 00:37:04,653
What would that do for your business?

461
00:37:05,592 --> 00:37:07,926
- You got a week, John.
- Thank you, Mr. Merrit.

462
00:37:17,912 --> 00:37:19,799
Thank you.

463
00:37:21,848 --> 00:37:24,303
Sir? In the third row there.

464
00:37:24,471 --> 00:37:27,154
Please stand up
and show us your handkerchief.

465
00:37:29,527 --> 00:37:30,641
This isn't mine.

466
00:37:30,807 --> 00:37:33,774
Perhaps you'd be so good as to return it
to the lady in the aisle.

467
00:37:33,943 --> 00:37:35,187
I believe she has yours.

468
00:37:38,648 --> 00:37:40,175
Thank you.

469
00:37:42,263 --> 00:37:44,565
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I'm making so many mistakes.

470
00:37:44,728 --> 00:37:46,483
I'm so nervous.

471
00:37:47,128 --> 00:37:49,069
The audience doesn't seem
to be responding.

472
00:37:49,239 --> 00:37:53,844
They've seen a lot of tricks before,
but not this next one.

473
00:38:02,263 --> 00:38:04,369
Put a cloth over.

474
00:38:04,537 --> 00:38:07,219
- Fingers crossed.
- I'll have the champagne ready.

475
00:38:22,456 --> 00:38:24,757
- You've seen this one before?
- We've seen them all.

476
00:38:24,918 --> 00:38:27,253
I'll make it a little harder then, shall I?

477
00:38:27,416 --> 00:38:32,631
Two volunteers, please. A lady
and a gentleman to hold this cage with me.

478
00:38:33,239 --> 00:38:36,818
I'll perform this feat in a manner
never before seen by yourselves...

479
00:38:36,983 --> 00:38:39,701
...or any other audience
anywhere in the world.

480
00:38:42,198 --> 00:38:46,127
Madam, if you'll place one hand on the back
of the cage, one hand on the front.

481
00:38:46,294 --> 00:38:50,004
Sir, one hand on the bottom of the cage,
one hand on the top.

482
00:39:03,027 --> 00:39:05,515
- Should have spotted him.
- You had a lot of plates going.

483
00:39:05,682 --> 00:39:07,853
- Don't suppose they'll let us do this again.
- No.

484
00:39:08,017 --> 00:39:11,662
- So, what's the climax of our show?
- Show? You don't have a show.

485
00:39:11,828 --> 00:39:13,353
We have a week's engagement.

486
00:39:13,523 --> 00:39:17,002
To perform magic, not butcher birds
and break my customers' fingers.

487
00:39:17,171 --> 00:39:19,505
Clear out. Anything here
in the morning gets burned.

488
00:39:19,665 --> 00:39:21,902
- Mr. Merrit...
- It's done, John.

489
00:39:22,066 --> 00:39:25,546
I've hired a comedian.
You know I hate comedians.

490
00:39:26,994 --> 00:39:29,099
Well, there's plenty of good theaters.

491
00:39:29,266 --> 00:39:33,095
If we can come up with a new trick,
change the name of the act...

492
00:39:33,267 --> 00:39:35,053
The name stays.

493
00:39:36,946 --> 00:39:41,735
Right. Well, then the new trick's
gonna have to be irresistible, then.

494
00:39:41,905 --> 00:39:43,596
I have a couple of methods to try out.

495
00:39:43,762 --> 00:39:46,926
And then we need a new angle
on the presentation.

496
00:39:47,089 --> 00:39:48,813
Oh, and if you need some inspiration...

497
00:39:48,978 --> 00:39:51,847
...there's a technical exposition
at the Albert Hall this week.

498
00:39:52,017 --> 00:39:54,570
Engineers, scientists, you know?

499
00:39:54,738 --> 00:39:57,770
That sort of thing
captures a public's imagination.

500
00:40:14,193 --> 00:40:17,390
Mind if I join you? Tesla sends me
down here during the storms.

501
00:40:17,555 --> 00:40:20,555
Perfect excuse to come join
the Great Danton for a drink.

502
00:40:21,714 --> 00:40:23,438
Two of them.

503
00:40:23,954 --> 00:40:26,375
Beautiful, isn't it, huh?
God, I miss New York though.

504
00:40:26,546 --> 00:40:28,815
- So why are you here?
- The lightning lives here.

505
00:40:28,978 --> 00:40:31,946
And not much else. Our work is secret.

506
00:40:32,689 --> 00:40:34,380
Is that a cipher?

507
00:40:36,498 --> 00:40:39,345
It's a rotating transposition
that shifts every day of the diary.

508
00:40:39,506 --> 00:40:43,214
Simple, but time-consuming to translate,
even when you have the five-letter keyword.

509
00:40:43,378 --> 00:40:45,036
Which is?

510
00:40:45,202 --> 00:40:47,025
We magicians have a circle of trust.

511
00:40:47,185 --> 00:40:50,959
You have a circle of trust
with someone whose diary you stole?

512
00:40:51,121 --> 00:40:52,104
Maybe I bought it.

513
00:40:52,914 --> 00:40:55,467
And you're hoping to find
a great secret in there.

514
00:40:55,635 --> 00:40:59,147
I've already found it.
That's why I'm here.

515
00:41:05,265 --> 00:41:08,080
Tesla built one for another magician.

516
00:41:08,241 --> 00:41:11,374
- Why would you want the same thing?
- Call it a professional rivalry.

517
00:41:11,889 --> 00:41:16,045
Mr. Tesla has built unusual machines
for unusual people.

518
00:41:16,209 --> 00:41:17,672
But he would never talk about it.

519
00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:20,657
I understand discretion.
I just want the machine.

520
00:41:23,825 --> 00:41:25,648
Finish your drink.

521
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:27,886
I wanna show you something.

522
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:31,149
I think you'll have a special appreciation
for our work.

523
00:41:31,314 --> 00:41:34,576
- I thought it was a secret.
- You're a magician.

524
00:41:34,738 --> 00:41:36,331
Who's gonna believe you?

525
00:41:37,585 --> 00:41:39,528
Not long now.

526
00:41:39,697 --> 00:41:42,000
Our equipment requires
a great deal of current.

527
00:41:42,161 --> 00:41:45,839
Tesla electrified the town in exchange
for using the generators when we need to.

528
00:41:47,954 --> 00:41:50,889
We do our tests
when the townspeople are asleep.

529
00:41:51,057 --> 00:41:53,545
Mr. Tesla doesn't wanna scare anyone.

530
00:42:10,801 --> 00:42:12,623
Where are the wires?

531
00:42:14,066 --> 00:42:15,146
Exactly.

532
00:42:24,081 --> 00:42:28,010
- Where's the generator?
- You saw it last week.

533
00:42:28,178 --> 00:42:31,024
- That must be 10 miles from here.
- Fifteen.

534
00:42:31,185 --> 00:42:34,316
And I have to ride all of them
before I get to bed.

535
00:42:35,185 --> 00:42:37,705
I'll send word for you
in a few days, Mr. Angier.

536
00:42:37,873 --> 00:42:41,736
Magic. Real magic.

537
00:42:43,857 --> 00:42:45,679
Now appearing only here
at London's Royal Albert Hall.

538
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,946
One of the miracles of our age.

539
00:42:48,113 --> 00:42:50,154
A technological marvel.

540
00:42:50,321 --> 00:42:52,459
You've never seen anything like it
in your lives.

541
00:42:52,624 --> 00:42:54,895
Your eyes will not believe
what they're witnessing.

542
00:42:55,056 --> 00:42:57,991
The miracle of Nikola Tesla,
ladies and gentlemen.

543
00:42:58,162 --> 00:43:00,463
Free clean power.
Would you like to know the future?

544
00:43:00,625 --> 00:43:02,861
The man speaking now
is going to change the world.

545
00:43:03,025 --> 00:43:07,663
Ladies and gentlemen, come one, come all.
Immediate seating, no waiting.

546
00:43:22,321 --> 00:43:25,321
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry...

547
00:43:25,489 --> 00:43:27,147
...but objections have been raised...

548
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:30,574
...concerning the safety...
- They should be. Does that look safe to you?

549
00:43:30,736 --> 00:43:33,038
Part of Thomas Edison's
smear campaign...

550
00:43:33,202 --> 00:43:36,911
...against Mr. Tesla's
superior alternating current.

551
00:43:37,073 --> 00:43:38,567
Mr. Alley, please.

552
00:43:38,736 --> 00:43:41,126
We have asked Mr. Tesla
to reconsider...

553
00:43:41,297 --> 00:43:43,817
- which he will not.
...his presentation.

554
00:43:43,985 --> 00:43:48,010
But I've been told he refuses
to appear under any such restrictions.

555
00:43:49,041 --> 00:43:51,343
Clear the hall!
This thing is gonna blow!

556
00:43:51,504 --> 00:43:53,993
- Clear the hall!
- Ladies and gentlemen, please!

557
00:43:54,641 --> 00:43:56,582
Where's the switch?

558
00:44:00,177 --> 00:44:02,511
This is all perfectly safe.

559
00:44:32,209 --> 00:44:33,191
Hey.

560
00:44:33,362 --> 00:44:34,855
Hello, you.

561
00:44:35,025 --> 00:44:37,675
Hello, Jess.

562
00:44:39,984 --> 00:44:42,636
Have you had a nice day with Mummy?

563
00:44:44,657 --> 00:44:47,656
Sarah, I love you.

564
00:44:47,825 --> 00:44:51,054
- See? Today it's true.
- Yeah.

565
00:44:51,216 --> 00:44:52,809
Hello.

566
00:44:53,808 --> 00:44:56,013
I saw happiness.

567
00:44:56,336 --> 00:44:59,184
Happiness that should have been mine.

568
00:44:59,344 --> 00:45:00,621
But I was wrong.

569
00:45:00,784 --> 00:45:05,160
His notebook reveals
that he never had the life that I envied.

570
00:45:05,328 --> 00:45:07,565
The family life
that he craves one minute...

571
00:45:07,728 --> 00:45:11,851
...he rails against the next,
demanding freedom.

572
00:45:12,016 --> 00:45:14,765
His mind...
His mind is a divided one.

573
00:45:14,928 --> 00:45:16,684
His soul is restless.

574
00:45:16,848 --> 00:45:22,794
His wife and child tormented
by his fickle and contradictory nature.

575
00:45:26,415 --> 00:45:28,718
What do you think?
What do you think you'll call her?

576
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,090
I don't know.

577
00:45:30,257 --> 00:45:32,394
Everybody needs a name.
So, what's hers?

578
00:45:33,296 --> 00:45:34,955
Maybe Sarah.

579
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:39,535
That's a lovely name.
That's a lovely name.

580
00:45:39,696 --> 00:45:42,696
You talk about what you wanna do
for the rest of the day.

581
00:45:42,863 --> 00:45:44,554
All right? Go on. You talk with her.

582
00:45:46,992 --> 00:45:48,903
They're taking her away?

583
00:45:51,024 --> 00:45:51,973
To the workhouse?

584
00:45:55,087 --> 00:45:57,030
Now, you keep talking.

585
00:45:59,632 --> 00:46:02,697
Tell owens I've reconsidered.
Take it. Go on, take it.

586
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,254
It's for the best.

587
00:46:14,192 --> 00:46:15,947
Let me see.

588
00:46:17,168 --> 00:46:21,772
- I'm gonna learn all the Professor's secrets.
- Only if I teach you how to read.

589
00:46:22,383 --> 00:46:24,489
They're just stupid tricks, right?

590
00:46:24,657 --> 00:46:27,307
Haven't helped you
get out of here, have they?

591
00:46:28,048 --> 00:46:31,180
Or can't you undo real locks, Professor?

592
00:46:32,336 --> 00:46:34,889
Well, maybe I'm just biding my time.

593
00:46:35,056 --> 00:46:40,652
Maybe one day I'll open my hand,
get your attention, ask:

594
00:46:40,815 --> 00:46:42,791
"Are you watching closely?"

595
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,611
Maybe a magic word or two.

596
00:46:47,439 --> 00:46:49,806
And then I'll be gone.

597
00:46:52,944 --> 00:46:56,042
How'd you get so famous, then, eh?

598
00:46:56,528 --> 00:46:58,087
Magic.

599
00:47:01,808 --> 00:47:03,182
Borden, get back here!

600
00:47:03,343 --> 00:47:04,750
Thank you.

601
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:07,532
Shut up! Get him down!

602
00:47:08,016 --> 00:47:09,838
Thank you.

603
00:47:10,128 --> 00:47:11,917
Who's got a bloody key?

604
00:47:18,255 --> 00:47:20,643
February 8th, 1899.

605
00:47:20,816 --> 00:47:22,703
Today, finally a breakthrough.

606
00:47:23,343 --> 00:47:25,383
Tesla"s agreed to see me.

607
00:47:32,848 --> 00:47:33,895
It's perfectly safe.

608
00:47:55,087 --> 00:47:58,054
So this is the Great Danton.

609
00:47:58,223 --> 00:48:02,663
Mr. Alley has effused about your act to me
on any number of occasions.

610
00:48:04,495 --> 00:48:05,902
Hold out other hand.

611
00:48:14,255 --> 00:48:16,011
What's conducting the electricity?

612
00:48:16,175 --> 00:48:19,339
Our bodies, Mr. Angier,
are quite capable of conducting...

613
00:48:19,503 --> 00:48:21,892
...and, indeed, producing energy.

614
00:48:23,407 --> 00:48:25,350
Have you eaten, Mr. Angier?

615
00:48:28,303 --> 00:48:30,213
I need something impossible.

616
00:48:31,983 --> 00:48:36,490
You are familiar with the phrase,
"Man's reach exceeds his grasp"?

617
00:48:37,008 --> 00:48:38,186
It's a lie.

618
00:48:38,351 --> 00:48:40,239
Man's grasp exceeds his nerve.

619
00:48:41,327 --> 00:48:44,110
Society only tolerates
one change at a time.

620
00:48:45,551 --> 00:48:48,650
The first time
I tried to change the world...

621
00:48:48,815 --> 00:48:50,377
...I was hailed as a visionary.

622
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:56,229
Second time,
I was asked politely to retire.

623
00:48:57,103 --> 00:49:00,038
So here I am, enjoying my retirement.

624
00:49:00,558 --> 00:49:02,382
Nothing is impossible, Mr. Angier.

625
00:49:02,543 --> 00:49:04,167
What you want is simply expensive.

626
00:49:04,784 --> 00:49:06,670
If I were to build for you this machine...

627
00:49:06,830 --> 00:49:09,383
...you would be presenting it
merely as illusion?

628
00:49:09,551 --> 00:49:12,780
Well, if people actually believed
the things I did on-stage...

629
00:49:12,942 --> 00:49:16,390
...they wouldn't clap, they'd scream.
I mean, think of sawing a woman in half.

630
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:19,309
Mr. Angier, have you considered
the cost of such a machine?

631
00:49:19,471 --> 00:49:21,226
Price is not an object.

632
00:49:21,871 --> 00:49:25,100
Perhaps not,
but have you considered the cost?

633
00:49:26,096 --> 00:49:27,306
I'm not sure I follow.

634
00:49:28,366 --> 00:49:30,090
Go home. Forget this thing.

635
00:49:30,512 --> 00:49:32,267
I can recognize an obsession.

636
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,341
No good will come of it.

637
00:49:34,511 --> 00:49:36,235
Hasn't good come of your obsessions?

638
00:49:36,879 --> 00:49:39,366
At first.
But I have followed them too long.

639
00:49:39,534 --> 00:49:44,751
I am their slave, and one day,
they will choose to destroy me.

640
00:49:46,255 --> 00:49:49,899
If you understand an obsession,
then you know you won't change my mind.

641
00:49:51,184 --> 00:49:52,132
So be it.

642
00:49:53,678 --> 00:49:54,857
Will you build it?

643
00:49:55,855 --> 00:49:59,203
I have already begun to build it,
Mr. Angier.

644
00:49:59,374 --> 00:50:01,644
I hope you enjoy the mountain air.

645
00:50:01,807 --> 00:50:04,043
This will take some time.

646
00:50:27,088 --> 00:50:28,875
I thought you'd gone.

647
00:50:29,806 --> 00:50:31,878
I don't really have anywhere to go.

648
00:50:34,639 --> 00:50:35,849
You've been sleeping here?

649
00:50:36,014 --> 00:50:40,236
Cutter said it would be all right till we get
another booking. What are you doing?

650
00:50:41,231 --> 00:50:42,540
Research.

651
00:50:42,703 --> 00:50:46,957
Part of a magician's job is to watch
his competition, to see what illusions...

652
00:50:47,118 --> 00:50:49,770
You're going to do something
to that man, aren't you?

653
00:50:49,935 --> 00:50:51,659
Cutter's hoping you'll let things lie.

654
00:50:51,822 --> 00:50:54,375
He says if Borden thinks things
are even between you two...

655
00:50:54,543 --> 00:50:55,852
Even?

656
00:50:56,399 --> 00:50:58,820
My wife for a couple of his fingers?

657
00:50:58,990 --> 00:51:01,773
He has a family now, right?
And he's performing again.

658
00:51:01,933 --> 00:51:05,512
Borden is living his life just as he always
intended, as if nothing had happened.

659
00:51:05,679 --> 00:51:07,652
And look at... Look at me, all right?

660
00:51:07,823 --> 00:51:10,572
- I'm alone and no theater will touch me.
- Us.

661
00:51:11,502 --> 00:51:14,055
You're going to need a better disguise.

662
00:51:30,477 --> 00:51:31,460
Need a volunteer.

663
00:51:32,848 --> 00:51:34,090
What happened?

664
00:51:35,151 --> 00:51:37,124
Did you hurt him?

665
00:51:38,735 --> 00:51:39,912
What happened, Robert?

666
00:51:42,254 --> 00:51:43,595
You, sir.

667
00:51:44,269 --> 00:51:46,987
Just a rubber ball, yes? Thank you.

668
00:51:47,149 --> 00:51:49,539
Just a rubber ball, no.

669
00:51:49,711 --> 00:51:52,777
Not normal. Not a normal rubber ball.

670
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:53,925
It's magic.

671
00:51:54,733 --> 00:51:56,589
He had a new trick.

672
00:52:09,935 --> 00:52:10,883
Was it good?

673
00:52:15,822 --> 00:52:18,123
It was the greatest magic trick
I've ever seen.

674
00:52:23,950 --> 00:52:25,412
Did they applaud when you saw it?

675
00:52:25,582 --> 00:52:27,524
The trick was too good,
it was too simple.

676
00:52:27,694 --> 00:52:30,628
- The audience hardly had time to see it.
- He's a dreadful magician.

677
00:52:30,798 --> 00:52:33,220
No, he's a wonderful magician.
He's a dreadful showman.

678
00:52:33,389 --> 00:52:35,529
He doesn't know how to dress it up,
how to sell...

679
00:52:35,695 --> 00:52:37,254
- How does he do it?
- Uses a double.

680
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:39,910
No, no, no, it's too simple.
This is a complex illusion.

681
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:42,380
You only say that
because you don't know the method.

682
00:52:42,542 --> 00:52:44,614
It's a double at the end.
It's the only way.

683
00:52:44,782 --> 00:52:46,855
I've seen him perform the trick
three times now.

684
00:52:47,022 --> 00:52:49,389
- The Prestige is the same man.
- No, it's not.

685
00:52:49,550 --> 00:52:51,917
The same man comes out
of that second cabinet.

686
00:52:52,077 --> 00:52:53,126
It's the same man.

687
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:56,620
He wears padded gloves
to hide his damaged fingers...

688
00:52:56,781 --> 00:52:58,570
...but if you look closely you can tell.

689
00:53:01,229 --> 00:53:03,750
He doesn't know how to sell it
to an audience, but I do.

690
00:53:03,918 --> 00:53:06,154
Yeah, well, we can use it
as a climax to the show.

691
00:53:06,572 --> 00:53:08,362
Yes.

692
00:53:08,526 --> 00:53:11,625
The man stole my life,
I'm gonna steal his trick.

693
00:53:11,790 --> 00:53:14,856
- We gotta find someone who looks like you.
- He doesn't use a double.

694
00:53:15,021 --> 00:53:18,218
Robert, I don't know
how Borden does the trick, so either...

695
00:53:18,383 --> 00:53:21,612
You either wait for him to retire
and buy the secret...

696
00:53:21,774 --> 00:53:23,465
...or you listen to how I would do it.

697
00:53:23,630 --> 00:53:28,331
And the only way that I know how to do it
is to find you a bloody good double.

698
00:53:29,230 --> 00:53:30,789
All right.

699
00:53:32,014 --> 00:53:34,402
Take a good look.
Let's get out there and find me.

700
00:53:36,527 --> 00:53:38,381
Look. Look.

701
00:53:42,317 --> 00:53:43,844
What's that?

702
00:53:44,973 --> 00:53:47,940
That is for you.

703
00:53:48,109 --> 00:53:49,799
What's this for?

704
00:53:49,967 --> 00:53:51,526
Come here.

705
00:53:56,493 --> 00:54:00,072
- I asked you last week. You said you...
- You caught me in a wrong mood.

706
00:54:00,301 --> 00:54:01,579
But you went over all the...

707
00:54:01,742 --> 00:54:05,125
Sarah, I'm allowed to change my mind,
aren't I?

708
00:54:05,614 --> 00:54:08,876
The act is taking off,
soon we'll be in a bigger theater.

709
00:54:09,037 --> 00:54:10,215
Things will work out.

710
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:14,183
I can't believe it. Thank you.

711
00:54:14,349 --> 00:54:16,172
Thank you. It's beautiful.

712
00:54:22,607 --> 00:54:24,297
Gerry?

713
00:54:24,685 --> 00:54:25,635
Darling, look at you.

714
00:54:25,806 --> 00:54:28,455
Mr. Cutter, Mr. Angier,
I'd like you to meet Gerald Root.

715
00:54:33,422 --> 00:54:36,652
A pleasure.
Pleasure to meet you fine gentlemen.

716
00:54:37,197 --> 00:54:40,939
Would you like for me
to tell you a little joke? Come here.

717
00:54:42,701 --> 00:54:44,589
There we are. Yes?

718
00:54:44,749 --> 00:54:46,690
Are you laughing now?

719
00:54:48,814 --> 00:54:51,497
Oh, dear, I have to take a piss.

720
00:54:53,132 --> 00:54:55,816
- He's out of his mind.
- Of course. He's an out-of-work actor.

721
00:54:55,982 --> 00:54:57,705
He's perfect. He needs a little help...

722
00:54:57,869 --> 00:55:00,586
...but when I get done with him,
he could be your brother.

723
00:55:00,749 --> 00:55:03,170
I don't need him to be my brother,
I need him to be me.

724
00:55:03,341 --> 00:55:04,835
Give me a month.

725
00:55:08,622 --> 00:55:10,344
Come around.

726
00:55:11,469 --> 00:55:15,659
So you open the door and...

727
00:55:22,604 --> 00:55:24,099
come on.

728
00:55:27,853 --> 00:55:31,430
- Couldn't you have found a softer one?
- Well, it's not for sleeping on.

729
00:55:32,014 --> 00:55:33,868
So if you come down through there...

730
00:55:36,491 --> 00:55:39,362
...does Root go up through there?
- Yep.

731
00:55:39,756 --> 00:55:41,415
It's going to be amazing, Robert.

732
00:55:41,933 --> 00:55:45,545
Well, it has to be.
Borden's trick is getting noticed.

733
00:55:47,532 --> 00:55:49,803
The place was packed today.

734
00:55:51,404 --> 00:55:53,064
You went and saw his show again.

735
00:55:53,229 --> 00:55:55,498
Ready to meet yourself, Mr. Angier?

736
00:56:03,789 --> 00:56:05,731
All I have to do is keep myself drunk...

737
00:56:05,902 --> 00:56:08,071
...and no one will be able
to tell the difference.

738
00:56:08,237 --> 00:56:10,059
Have a little faith, sir.

739
00:56:10,221 --> 00:56:14,890
Now, would you favor us
with a performance, Mr. Root?

740
00:56:18,637 --> 00:56:20,012
Jesus.

741
00:56:34,765 --> 00:56:37,831
Yes, you would drink too
if you knew the world half as well as I do.

742
00:56:41,517 --> 00:56:43,011
Did you think you were unique?

743
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:45,570
I have been caesar. I played Faust.

744
00:56:45,742 --> 00:56:48,589
How difficult could it possibly be
to play the Great Danton?

745
00:56:48,749 --> 00:56:51,781
You can go back to being yourself now,
Root, for nothing.

746
00:56:51,949 --> 00:56:54,021
I'd rather be him for now.

747
00:56:54,189 --> 00:56:56,872
I find it amusing.

748
00:57:00,141 --> 00:57:04,036
My liege, I did deny no prisoners.

749
00:57:05,132 --> 00:57:06,954
- You look wonderful.
- Oh, thank you.

750
00:57:07,117 --> 00:57:10,085
Root has to keep a low profile.
Anyone sees him, the game's up.

751
00:57:10,253 --> 00:57:13,067
I don't know how you do these things.
I'm not sure I wanna know.

752
00:57:13,453 --> 00:57:15,525
Have you thought
what we should call the trick?

753
00:57:15,692 --> 00:57:16,844
There's no point in being coy. Borden
calls his trick "The Transported Man."

754
00:57:16,844 --> 00:57:19,113
There's no point in being coy. Borden
calls his trick "The Transported Man."

755
00:57:23,245 --> 00:57:25,733
Ladies and gentlemen,
much of what you've seen tonight...

756
00:57:25,901 --> 00:57:30,919
...may be termed as illusions
or entertaining trifles.

757
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:35,461
Alas...

758
00:57:37,548 --> 00:57:39,915
...I cannot claim
this next feat as illusion.

759
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:41,893
Watch carefully.

760
00:57:43,308 --> 00:57:45,675
You'll see no trickery...

761
00:57:46,125 --> 00:57:47,619
...for no trickery is employed.

762
00:57:48,748 --> 00:57:51,945
Merely a technique familiar
to certain citizens of the orient...

763
00:57:52,108 --> 00:57:54,212
...and various holy men
of the Himalayas.

764
00:57:57,516 --> 00:58:00,135
Indeed, many of you
may be familiar with this technique...

765
00:58:00,301 --> 00:58:03,201
...but for those of you who aren't,
do not be alarmed...

766
00:58:03,372 --> 00:58:06,306
...what you're about to see
is considered safe.

767
00:58:37,005 --> 00:58:38,978
To our achievement.

768
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:42,179
The manager says
he's never seen a reaction like it.

769
00:58:42,348 --> 00:58:45,446
At least he got to see it.
I spent the ovation hiding under the stage.

770
00:58:45,612 --> 00:58:47,946
No one cares about the man
who disappears into the box.

771
00:58:48,107 --> 00:58:49,734
They care about the one who comes out.

772
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:52,582
- I care about the man in the box.
- Thank you.

773
00:58:52,748 --> 00:58:55,977
I don't know. Maybe...
Maybe we could switch before the trick.

774
00:58:56,139 --> 00:58:58,180
I could be the Prestige
and Root ends up below.

775
00:58:58,348 --> 00:59:00,934
No, the anticipation of the trick
is everything.

776
00:59:01,101 --> 00:59:04,003
We need your showmanship
to build up the suspense.

777
00:59:04,172 --> 00:59:07,303
Once Root opens his mouth, it's over.
He can't introduce this trick.

778
00:59:07,467 --> 00:59:10,185
Of course I can. I'm the Great Danton.

779
00:59:10,348 --> 00:59:13,696
Root, you bloody fool.
Get out of that wardrobe and makeup.

780
00:59:13,867 --> 00:59:16,290
Anyone could walk in here at any minute.

781
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:18,371
Congratulations, all.

782
00:59:18,561 --> 00:59:21,825
Life is not full of these moments, Robbie.
we worked hard.

783
00:59:21,987 --> 00:59:23,515
we need to celebrate properly.

784
00:59:27,045 --> 00:59:29,464
what's wrong? Is it your wife?

785
00:59:29,634 --> 00:59:31,773
No. No, it's the trick.
It isn't good enough.

786
00:59:31,937 --> 00:59:35,005
Borden's trick is nothing compared to ours.
He has no style.

787
00:59:35,170 --> 00:59:38,848
well, he doesn't spend the finale
hiding under the stage.

788
00:59:39,011 --> 00:59:40,637
I need to know how he does it.

789
00:59:40,803 --> 00:59:44,031
-why?
-So I can do it better.

790
00:59:46,146 --> 00:59:48,002
I need you to go and work for him.

791
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:53,053
work for him? Are you joking?

792
00:59:54,308 --> 00:59:55,388
You'll be my spy.

793
00:59:55,556 --> 00:59:57,531
we just got our start.
You want me to leave?

794
00:59:57,701 --> 00:59:59,643
That's how we advance.
Think of it, olivia.

795
00:59:59,812 --> 01:00:03,294
we got people excited, but imagine
what we could do with the reaI illusion.

796
01:00:03,461 --> 01:00:07,136
we'd have the greatest magic act
anyone's ever seen.

797
01:00:07,299 --> 01:00:08,642
He knows I work for you.

798
01:00:08,803 --> 01:00:11,937
Exactly why he'll wanna hire you.
He'll want my secret.

799
01:00:12,101 --> 01:00:15,996
-why would he trust me?
-Because you're gonna tell him the truth.

800
01:00:27,876 --> 01:00:28,825
Good girI.

801
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:35,290
You must be curious to see what
so much money has bought you, Mr. Angier.

802
01:00:35,909 --> 01:00:38,659
It's fitting you should be here
for maiden voyage.

803
01:00:38,822 --> 01:00:40,446
Your hat.

804
01:00:48,261 --> 01:00:50,400
You might wanna stand back.

805
01:01:10,375 --> 01:01:11,323
I don't understand.

806
01:01:11,495 --> 01:01:13,698
Perhaps it would be best
if you left us to it.

807
01:01:13,863 --> 01:01:15,902
-Is there a problem, Mr. Tesla?
-No, no, no.

808
01:01:16,070 --> 01:01:17,530
-come back next week.
-Next week?

809
01:01:17,701 --> 01:01:19,709
-come back-- Next week, it'll be fine.
-Tesla.

810
01:01:19,876 --> 01:01:22,529
She's just a little temperamentaI
sometimes.

811
01:01:27,239 --> 01:01:29,921
-Interesting workshop.
-Yeah, we make do.

812
01:01:30,086 --> 01:01:32,321
-My name is olivia wenscombe--
-I know who you are.

813
01:01:32,487 --> 01:01:33,731
You here to steaI my show?

814
01:01:33,895 --> 01:01:35,616
I'm here to give it what it's missing.

815
01:01:35,781 --> 01:01:38,816
-Yeah? what might that be?
-Me.

816
01:01:40,327 --> 01:01:44,102
I was just saying that, wasn't I, Bernard?
woman's touch.

817
01:01:44,261 --> 01:01:46,019
-I've left Angier.
-All right.

818
01:01:46,182 --> 01:01:48,799
-I want a job.
-Yeah?

819
01:01:48,968 --> 01:01:51,815
-I know you've no reason to trust me--
-why wouldn't I trust you?

820
01:01:51,975 --> 01:01:55,683
I mean, you're only the mistress
of my enemy. why wouldn't I trust you?

821
01:01:57,190 --> 01:01:59,013
-Mr. Borden--
-AIfred.

822
01:02:01,349 --> 01:02:02,844
I'm going to tell you the truth.

823
01:02:03,014 --> 01:02:06,047
Now that is a slippery notion
in our line of work...

824
01:02:06,214 --> 01:02:07,458
...isn't it, Miss wenscombe?

825
01:02:09,510 --> 01:02:11,966
I am here because he sent me here.

826
01:02:12,134 --> 01:02:14,503
He wants me to work for you
and steaI your secret.

827
01:02:14,664 --> 01:02:16,257
what does he need my secret for?

828
01:02:16,423 --> 01:02:17,765
His trick is top-notch.

829
01:02:18,343 --> 01:02:21,443
He vanishes and then he reappears
on the other side of the stage...

830
01:02:21,609 --> 01:02:25,285
...mute, overweight and,
unless I'm mistaken, very drunk.

831
01:02:25,448 --> 01:02:27,042
It's astonishing. How does he do it?

832
01:02:27,465 --> 01:02:32,132
And tell me, olivia, does he enjoy
taking his bows under the stage?

833
01:02:32,296 --> 01:02:33,276
No, it's killing him.

834
01:02:33,446 --> 01:02:35,355
He's obsessed
with discovering your methods.

835
01:02:35,528 --> 01:02:36,673
He thinks of nothing eIse.

836
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:39,775
He takes no pleasure in our success,
and I've had enough.

837
01:02:39,946 --> 01:02:41,319
There is no future with him.

838
01:02:43,432 --> 01:02:46,914
He sent me here to steaI your secrets,
but I've actually come to offer you his.

839
01:02:47,399 --> 01:02:50,815
This is the truth, is it?

840
01:02:55,143 --> 01:02:56,769
Think you'd better get dressed, sir.

841
01:02:56,936 --> 01:02:59,075
Root, you're late
and more drunk than usuaI.

842
01:02:59,241 --> 01:03:01,761
-Now, get down below stairs right away.
-No.

843
01:03:03,274 --> 01:03:06,238
No, we need to have
a little chat, Mr. cutter.

844
01:03:06,408 --> 01:03:07,390
we have a problem.

845
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:10,016
cutter, Borden is performing
right across the street.

846
01:03:10,184 --> 01:03:12,704
Yeah? we have a bigger problem.

847
01:03:13,801 --> 01:03:16,615
Root. He's realized
he can make demands.

848
01:03:17,449 --> 01:03:18,692
wha--? He's blackmailing us?

849
01:03:18,855 --> 01:03:22,852
I was surprised, to tell you the truth.
It usually takes them longer to figure it out.

850
01:03:23,016 --> 01:03:25,700
-well, how much does he want?
-well, it makes no difference.

851
01:03:25,865 --> 01:03:29,127
-we gotta stop doing the trick.
-Stop the trick? cutter, look at this.

852
01:03:29,289 --> 01:03:31,329
well, look at yesterday's,
look at last week...

853
01:03:31,498 --> 01:03:34,726
...where they said you were
the premier stage performer in London.

854
01:03:34,888 --> 01:03:36,383
Not magician, mind you.

855
01:03:36,553 --> 01:03:39,042
-Performer of any kind.
-well, what's your point?

856
01:03:39,211 --> 01:03:41,381
My point is, Robert,
is you've climbed too high...

857
01:03:41,544 --> 01:03:43,650
...to get away
with professionaI embarrassment.

858
01:03:44,234 --> 01:03:46,917
we don't do any tricks we can't controI.

859
01:03:49,035 --> 01:03:50,757
Just pay him whatever he wants for now.

860
01:03:50,921 --> 01:03:54,184
we keep doing the trick untiI Borden opens
and then we'll phase it out.

861
01:03:55,242 --> 01:03:56,616
All right.

862
01:03:59,210 --> 01:04:03,040
Cutter was always surprised
how fast Root turned bad.

863
01:04:03,593 --> 01:04:07,422
To what do I owe the pleasure
of this rather weIcome pint of ale?

864
01:04:07,593 --> 01:04:10,822
You're the Great Danton, aren't you?

865
01:04:10,985 --> 01:04:14,182
of course I am, but don't advertise it
because I'll be mobbed with fans.

866
01:04:14,347 --> 01:04:16,170
We paid him enough
to keep him in beers...

867
01:04:16,330 --> 01:04:18,369
...so you wouldn"t expect him
to rock the boat.

868
01:04:18,538 --> 01:04:20,992
Indeed, many of you
may be familiar with this technique.

869
01:04:21,163 --> 01:04:24,642
But for those of you who aren't,
do not be alarmed...

870
01:04:24,809 --> 01:04:27,713
...what you're about to see
is considered safe.

871
01:04:27,883 --> 01:04:29,127
And who are you?

872
01:04:29,291 --> 01:04:34,888
I am a humble admirer
and a fellow practitioner.

873
01:04:35,052 --> 01:04:36,162
very good.

874
01:04:45,259 --> 01:04:47,846
-Another?
-oh, if you insist.

875
01:04:48,010 --> 01:04:49,833
-Another.
-I'm not performing tonight.

876
01:04:49,996 --> 01:04:51,654
well, I'm only doing one show...

877
01:04:51,820 --> 01:04:54,885
...but to be frank, my people
pretty much run things these days.

878
01:04:55,050 --> 01:04:56,097
Get up there!

879
01:04:57,514 --> 01:04:58,463
Get up!

880
01:04:58,636 --> 01:05:00,708
Your illusion, The Transported Man...

881
01:05:00,876 --> 01:05:03,725
...I'm not claiming
to know your methods or anything...

882
01:05:04,396 --> 01:05:10,595
...but I had a similar trick in my act,
and I used a double.

883
01:05:11,946 --> 01:05:12,995
I see. very good.

884
01:05:13,162 --> 01:05:15,616
well, it was, and then it went bad.

885
01:05:15,787 --> 01:05:20,970
what I didn't count on, was that
when I incorporated this bloke into my act...

886
01:05:21,130 --> 01:05:23,019
...he had complete power over me.

887
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:25,707
complete power, you say.

888
01:05:42,570 --> 01:05:47,525
Be very careful giving someone
that power over you.

889
01:05:49,803 --> 01:05:51,692
well, thank you.

890
01:05:51,852 --> 01:05:54,025
Yes, thank you for the warning.

891
01:05:56,110 --> 01:05:58,020
cheers.

892
01:05:58,734 --> 01:06:00,642
I cannot claim this next feat as illusion.

893
01:06:00,811 --> 01:06:04,840
what you're about to see
is considered safe.

894
01:06:43,214 --> 01:06:45,318
The Great Danton.

895
01:06:51,439 --> 01:06:53,031
I apologize.

896
01:06:53,198 --> 01:06:56,776
There simply is too much magic...

897
01:06:56,943 --> 01:07:01,732
...for my stage at the Pantages
across the street.

898
01:07:03,055 --> 01:07:05,476
-Bravo!
-Bravo!

899
01:07:05,645 --> 01:07:08,908
Pardon my intrusion.

900
01:07:09,551 --> 01:07:12,268
-Bravo!
-And go easy on the poor chap.

901
01:07:12,430 --> 01:07:15,398
He does try so very hard.

902
01:07:17,902 --> 01:07:19,658
I don't know how Borden found him.

903
01:07:19,821 --> 01:07:21,448
Kept him under wraps, I was careful.

904
01:07:21,613 --> 01:07:23,555
Yeah, well, he did.

905
01:07:24,368 --> 01:07:25,415
Do you think it was her?

906
01:07:32,559 --> 01:07:35,081
You weren't expecting me?

907
01:07:35,247 --> 01:07:37,798
I was expecting you sooner.
Your message said afternoon.

908
01:07:37,967 --> 01:07:40,008
It takes a bit
for me to get around these days.

909
01:07:40,336 --> 01:07:41,896
He's taken everything from me.

910
01:07:42,063 --> 01:07:44,648
My wife, my career, now you.

911
01:07:44,814 --> 01:07:46,124
what do you mean?
You sent me--

912
01:07:46,287 --> 01:07:48,840
I sent you to steaI his secret,
not to improve his act.

913
01:07:49,007 --> 01:07:50,414
-That's my job.
-or fall in love.

914
01:07:50,575 --> 01:07:53,033
-I did everything you asked!
-Yes? Yes?

915
01:07:53,199 --> 01:07:55,620
-Then how does he do it?
-cutter was right, a double.

916
01:07:55,790 --> 01:07:58,922
-of course Borden said that.
-He didn't say anything. I've seen things.

917
01:07:59,088 --> 01:08:02,699
Makeup, glasses, wigs. we don't use it
for the show, but I've seen it backstage.

918
01:08:02,863 --> 01:08:06,441
It's misdirection. He leaves things around
to make you think he's using a double.

919
01:08:06,606 --> 01:08:08,395
All the time?
He doesn't know when I look.

920
01:08:08,559 --> 01:08:10,413
All the time, olivia!

921
01:08:10,576 --> 01:08:12,780
That's who he is! That's what it takes!

922
01:08:12,944 --> 01:08:15,213
He lives his act! Don't you see?

923
01:08:17,264 --> 01:08:20,330
Just because you're sleeping with him
doesn't mean he trusts you.

924
01:08:20,496 --> 01:08:22,732
You think you can see everything,
don't you?

925
01:08:22,897 --> 01:08:26,376
But the Great Danton is a blind fooI.
His notebook.

926
01:08:28,368 --> 01:08:30,407
You stole it?

927
01:08:30,576 --> 01:08:32,267
I borrowed it for tonight.

928
01:08:32,432 --> 01:08:34,320
I thought you could translate it,
but now--

929
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:35,495
-I can't.
-You can't?

930
01:08:35,664 --> 01:08:38,382
olivia, no one can, it's a cipher.

931
01:08:38,546 --> 01:08:41,361
Even with the keyword
it would take months to decode.

932
01:08:41,841 --> 01:08:44,655
-And without the keyword?
-Perhaps never.

933
01:08:44,817 --> 01:08:46,159
-we'll see.
-we will not see.

934
01:08:46,321 --> 01:08:49,135
If I don't get that back to him tomorrow,
he'll know I took it.

935
01:08:49,296 --> 01:08:51,369
-Leave him.
-I can't. He knows where I live.

936
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:54,576
This is his diary, olivia.

937
01:08:54,736 --> 01:08:57,256
All of his secrets
are right here in my hands.

938
01:08:58,224 --> 01:08:59,402
won't bring your wife back.

939
01:08:59,571 --> 01:09:02,603
I don't care about my wife,
I care about his secret.

940
01:09:14,896 --> 01:09:16,620
Look...

941
01:09:17,616 --> 01:09:19,690
...I'll go to his workshop
and stage a break-in.

942
01:09:19,856 --> 01:09:23,851
-He'll know you took it.
-Yes, me. Not you.

943
01:09:24,018 --> 01:09:25,708
Understand?

944
01:09:34,226 --> 01:09:35,437
Robert.

945
01:09:37,330 --> 01:09:39,883
I have fallen in love with him.

946
01:09:40,852 --> 01:09:43,435
Then I know how hard
this has been for you.

947
01:09:51,475 --> 01:09:52,653
Notebook?

948
01:09:55,443 --> 01:09:57,233
Then he's just getting started.

949
01:10:26,451 --> 01:10:27,945
-Good evening.
-Professor.

950
01:10:29,682 --> 01:10:30,761
Professor.

951
01:10:31,219 --> 01:10:32,910
-Here.
-could I get your autograph?

952
01:10:33,076 --> 01:10:34,481
-I'm waIking tonight.
-Professor.

953
01:10:34,644 --> 01:10:36,367
Let him come. I don't care.

954
01:10:36,533 --> 01:10:38,835
-Professor.
-Professor.

955
01:12:00,118 --> 01:12:02,484
-You all right?
-I'm alive.

956
01:12:02,645 --> 01:12:04,653
Saves me cutting you an air hole.

957
01:12:18,165 --> 01:12:20,532
-I'm impressed.
-why's that?

958
01:12:20,694 --> 01:12:23,084
You're finally getting your hands dirty.

959
01:12:23,606 --> 01:12:26,290
It's what a good trick costs, Angier.

960
01:12:26,453 --> 01:12:27,730
Risk.

961
01:12:27,893 --> 01:12:29,072
Sacrifice.

962
01:12:29,588 --> 01:12:33,102
The sacrifice, I'm afraid, is gonna be yours,
unless you give me what I want.

963
01:12:34,518 --> 01:12:36,493
-which is?
-Your secret.

964
01:12:37,014 --> 01:12:38,803
My secret?

965
01:12:38,968 --> 01:12:41,141
Your method for The Transported Man.

966
01:12:41,302 --> 01:12:43,788
Fallon wouldn't tell me.
He doesn't seem to taIk at all.

967
01:12:43,958 --> 01:12:45,169
You have my notebook.

968
01:12:45,333 --> 01:12:47,189
Useless without the keyword.

969
01:12:48,629 --> 01:12:50,191
write down your method, Mr. Borden.

970
01:12:50,359 --> 01:12:52,148
Describe it in full.

971
01:13:04,696 --> 01:13:07,182
I want the whole method,
not the keyword.

972
01:13:07,351 --> 01:13:09,654
I don't even know
if your secret's in your notebook.

973
01:13:09,817 --> 01:13:11,987
The keyword is the method.

974
01:13:15,641 --> 01:13:16,753
where's my ingenieur?

975
01:13:23,768 --> 01:13:26,103
-Alive?
-How fast can you dig?

976
01:13:28,569 --> 01:13:31,417
Fallon! You hear me? Fallon!

977
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:35,215
-How's the arm?
-Still attached.

978
01:13:36,696 --> 01:13:38,932
-Did you find your answer?
-our answer.

979
01:13:39,095 --> 01:13:41,777
cutter, I haven't looked yet.
I wanted you to share this.

980
01:13:41,943 --> 01:13:44,311
I aIready know how he does it, Robert.

981
01:13:44,471 --> 01:13:47,222
The same way he aIways has.
The same way as we do.

982
01:13:47,383 --> 01:13:49,654
It's just that you want something more.

983
01:13:49,816 --> 01:13:51,343
well, let's find out then,
shall we?

984
01:13:56,632 --> 01:13:57,875
what does it mean?

985
01:14:05,623 --> 01:14:07,796
It means, cutter,
we have a journey ahead of us.

986
01:14:07,959 --> 01:14:10,578
-To America.
-Robert?

987
01:14:10,745 --> 01:14:12,786
Listen to me.

988
01:14:13,688 --> 01:14:16,919
obsession is a young man's game.

989
01:14:17,082 --> 01:14:20,856
-oh, come on.
-I can't follow you any further in it.

990
01:14:22,044 --> 01:14:23,701
I can't. I'm sorry.

991
01:14:27,834 --> 01:14:29,263
Then the rest is up to me.

992
01:14:31,289 --> 01:14:32,849
I'm sorry.

993
01:14:37,850 --> 01:14:41,112
Good evening. Hello, darling.

994
01:14:41,530 --> 01:14:42,839
champagne, your finest.

995
01:14:43,546 --> 01:14:45,848
I didn't know we were
going to be joined for dinner.

996
01:14:46,009 --> 01:14:48,825
-AbsoIutely. we are celebrating.
-Miss wenscombe.

997
01:14:48,985 --> 01:14:51,800
Mr. Fallon.
well, what are we celebrating?

998
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:54,295
well, we've hit upon a new trick,
haven't we, Fallon?

999
01:14:54,456 --> 01:14:57,239
-what trick, Freddy?
-Yes, Freddy, what trick?

1000
01:14:57,402 --> 01:15:01,495
I am going to bury myseIf alive
every night...

1001
01:15:01,657 --> 01:15:05,270
...and then someone will come along
and dig me up. wonderful.

1002
01:15:05,434 --> 01:15:09,176
-No, I think my husband's had quite enough.
-No, pour the champagne. come on, pour--

1003
01:15:09,338 --> 01:15:11,955
Right. Sarah, don't taIk to me like that.
I'm not a child.

1004
01:15:12,121 --> 01:15:14,009
-Perhaps it would--
-Perhaps, Mr. Fallon...

1005
01:15:14,171 --> 01:15:17,104
...you might escort Miss wenscombe home.
My husband's being a bore.

1006
01:15:17,274 --> 01:15:20,688
-I see no reason why you have to suffer.
-oh, please. Don't ruin this evening.

1007
01:15:23,993 --> 01:15:27,409
Good night, Mrs. Borden.
Good night, Freddy.

1008
01:15:31,066 --> 01:15:33,106
-''Freddy''?
-well, that's my name.

1009
01:15:33,276 --> 01:15:37,367
-Not at home.
-well, I'm not aIways at home, am I?

1010
01:15:38,298 --> 01:15:41,201
well, couldn't you have at least
taken off the beard?

1011
01:15:41,371 --> 01:15:44,754
Sarah, I just came from
the bloody theater just now.

1012
01:15:44,922 --> 01:15:46,549
All right? And I'm out in public.

1013
01:15:46,715 --> 01:15:49,715
-Everybody eIse loves it.
-why are you being like this, AIfred?

1014
01:15:50,332 --> 01:15:52,535
I had a terrible ordeaI today.

1015
01:15:52,893 --> 01:15:57,148
I thought that something very precious...

1016
01:15:57,309 --> 01:15:59,131
...had been lost to me.

1017
01:15:59,290 --> 01:16:02,258
So I just wanted to celebrate.
Just a little.

1018
01:16:03,036 --> 01:16:04,597
All right, what?

1019
01:16:04,764 --> 01:16:06,421
what did you lose?

1020
01:16:10,811 --> 01:16:12,121
I see, more secrets.

1021
01:16:13,053 --> 01:16:16,019
Sarah, secrets are my life.

1022
01:16:17,979 --> 01:16:19,921
-our life.
-No, AIfred, stop.

1023
01:16:20,090 --> 01:16:23,473
This isn't you. Stop performing.

1024
01:16:46,716 --> 01:16:49,138
I thought I had the place
to myseIf, Mr. Brent.

1025
01:16:49,310 --> 01:16:50,617
Unexpected guests.

1026
01:16:50,781 --> 01:16:54,074
Not very polite. A lot of questions.

1027
01:16:54,235 --> 01:16:56,756
First I thought they might work
for the government.

1028
01:16:56,925 --> 01:16:58,713
-No?
-worse.

1029
01:16:58,878 --> 01:17:00,983
They work for Thomas Edison.

1030
01:17:02,302 --> 01:17:04,603
Today, a most curious development.

1031
01:17:04,764 --> 01:17:08,627
His assistant came to us
with a proposition.

1032
01:17:09,406 --> 01:17:12,535
Obviously, Angier has sent her
and told her to admit as much.

1033
01:17:12,701 --> 01:17:15,319
Does he enjoy taking
his bows under the stage?

1034
01:17:15,485 --> 01:17:18,997
He sent me here to steaI your secrets,
but I've actually come to offer you his.

1035
01:17:19,484 --> 01:17:22,900
This is the truth, is it?

1036
01:17:30,716 --> 01:17:33,880
No, that's what he told me to tell you.
The truth...

1037
01:17:34,045 --> 01:17:37,690
...is that I loved him, and I stood by him,
and he sent me to you...

1038
01:17:37,853 --> 01:17:41,082
...like he would send a stagehand
to pick up his shirts.

1039
01:17:41,245 --> 01:17:43,799
I hate him for that.

1040
01:17:44,125 --> 01:17:47,803
I can spot Angier's methods
from the back of the theater.

1041
01:17:48,927 --> 01:17:50,869
So, what could you possibly
have to offer me?

1042
01:17:51,359 --> 01:17:54,008
You know how he does his tricks,
but you can't understand...

1043
01:17:54,175 --> 01:17:56,541
...why no one can see yours are better.
You hide this.

1044
01:17:56,702 --> 01:18:00,476
I had to look very closely to spot it when
you were performing The Transported Man...

1045
01:18:00,638 --> 01:18:03,159
...but this makes you unique.

1046
01:18:03,328 --> 01:18:05,398
It shows the audience
you aren't using a double.

1047
01:18:05,566 --> 01:18:07,572
You mustn't hide it,
display it proudly.

1048
01:18:07,743 --> 01:18:11,834
I'm sure it takes great skill
to perform illusions with one good hand.

1049
01:18:12,288 --> 01:18:14,229
Yeah, it does.

1050
01:18:15,712 --> 01:18:18,166
So let people know.

1051
01:18:18,814 --> 01:18:22,394
You could be so much more than he is,
and I can show you how.

1052
01:18:23,869 --> 01:18:25,561
I think she"s telling the truth.

1053
01:18:26,398 --> 01:18:28,438
I think we cannot trust her.

1054
01:18:31,901 --> 01:18:34,204
But I love her. I need her.

1055
01:18:35,455 --> 01:18:38,389
To open myself to such a relationship...

1056
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:42,268
...to the dangers of such an affair...

1057
01:18:42,753 --> 01:18:46,941
...I need assurances of fidelity. Of love.

1058
01:18:47,998 --> 01:18:49,427
But how to be sure?

1059
01:18:51,744 --> 01:18:55,802
I know a way.
It"s the only way to know her mind.

1060
01:18:55,966 --> 01:18:57,561
How could he send you away?

1061
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:01,148
She must help me rid ourselves
of Angier.

1062
01:19:08,768 --> 01:19:11,451
Today, my mistress proves
her truthfulness.

1063
01:19:11,617 --> 01:19:13,789
Not to me, you understand.

1064
01:19:13,984 --> 01:19:15,894
I"ve been convinced
since she led me to Root.

1065
01:19:16,065 --> 01:19:21,595
Today, Olivia proves her love for me
to you, Angier.

1066
01:19:21,758 --> 01:19:23,581
Yes, Angier.

1067
01:19:23,745 --> 01:19:25,947
She gave you this notebook
at my request.

1068
01:19:26,114 --> 01:19:31,067
And, yes, ''Tesla '' is merely the key
to my diary, not to my trick.

1069
01:19:31,232 --> 01:19:35,574
Did you really think I"d part
with my secret so easily after so much?

1070
01:19:35,743 --> 01:19:36,923
Goodbye, Angier.

1071
01:19:37,088 --> 01:19:41,016
May you find solace for your thwarted
ambition back in your American home.

1072
01:19:50,817 --> 01:19:51,266
Tesla!

1073
01:19:53,568 --> 01:19:57,976
Tesla! Alley! Alley!

1074
01:19:58,146 --> 01:20:00,446
Tesla never made a machine
like the one I asked for.

1075
01:20:00,609 --> 01:20:03,227
-we never said he had.
-But you let me believe that he had.

1076
01:20:03,393 --> 01:20:05,913
You stole my money because
your funding had been cut off.

1077
01:20:06,082 --> 01:20:09,692
You've been shooting sparks at my top hat,
laughing at me all along...

1078
01:20:09,858 --> 01:20:12,224
...while using my money
to stave off ruin.

1079
01:20:13,217 --> 01:20:15,072
-Now, I have seen Edison's men.
-where?

1080
01:20:15,234 --> 01:20:18,080
In the hoteI. And I have every mind
to bring them up here myseIf.

1081
01:20:18,242 --> 01:20:20,186
That would be unwise, Mr. Angier.

1082
01:20:20,354 --> 01:20:23,257
It is true that you are
our last remaining financier...

1083
01:20:23,426 --> 01:20:25,116
...but we have not stolen your money.

1084
01:20:25,283 --> 01:20:26,559
Sir, my cat.

1085
01:20:26,723 --> 01:20:29,623
when I told you I could make
your machine, I spoke a simple truth.

1086
01:20:29,793 --> 01:20:33,055
-Then why isn't the machine working?
-Because exact science, Mr. Angier...

1087
01:20:33,218 --> 01:20:34,430
...is not an exact science.

1088
01:20:34,817 --> 01:20:37,568
The machine simply does not operate
as expected.

1089
01:20:37,730 --> 01:20:39,903
It requires further examination.

1090
01:20:40,067 --> 01:20:42,554
-So where did my top hat go?
-Nowhere.

1091
01:20:42,722 --> 01:20:45,373
we tried the damn thing a dozen times.

1092
01:20:45,540 --> 01:20:46,816
The hat went nowhere.

1093
01:20:46,979 --> 01:20:48,832
we need to try different materiaI.

1094
01:20:48,995 --> 01:20:52,508
It may provoke a different result.

1095
01:20:53,409 --> 01:20:55,002
copernicus, come on.

1096
01:21:01,891 --> 01:21:06,200
You are responsible for whatever happens
to this animaI, doctor.

1097
01:21:26,436 --> 01:21:29,948
I hope that whatever you were really doing
with my money was more worthwhile...

1098
01:21:30,115 --> 01:21:31,970
...Mr. Tesla.

1099
01:22:24,835 --> 01:22:25,784
Alley!

1100
01:22:29,061 --> 01:22:30,238
So the machine was working.

1101
01:22:30,403 --> 01:22:33,787
I never bothered to check the calibration
because the hat never moved.

1102
01:22:33,957 --> 01:22:36,893
These things never quite work
as you expect them to, Mr. Angier.

1103
01:22:37,062 --> 01:22:39,135
That's one of the principaI
beauties of science.

1104
01:22:39,301 --> 01:22:42,530
I'll need a couple of weeks to iron out
the problems with the machine.

1105
01:22:42,695 --> 01:22:44,798
we'll send word when it's ready.

1106
01:22:46,917 --> 01:22:48,924
Don't forget your hat.

1107
01:22:49,734 --> 01:22:53,346
-well, which one is mine?
-They're all your hats, Mr. Angier.

1108
01:22:59,109 --> 01:23:01,892
You look so pretty
in this new dress of yours.

1109
01:23:02,053 --> 01:23:05,764
-Are we going to the zoo this afternoon?
-No, no, no. Daddy has some errands to run.

1110
01:23:05,926 --> 01:23:07,835
-But you promised.
-I promised, did I?

1111
01:23:08,007 --> 01:23:10,080
Then go to the zoo we shall.

1112
01:23:10,246 --> 01:23:13,410
So Daddy will go run his errands
and I'll be back before you know it...

1113
01:23:13,573 --> 01:23:17,119
...so you go get ready.
we'll go see those chimpanzees.

1114
01:23:20,262 --> 01:23:22,151
Sarah.

1115
01:23:22,502 --> 01:23:23,483
what are you doing?

1116
01:23:26,887 --> 01:23:29,885
we each of us have our vices.

1117
01:23:32,806 --> 01:23:36,100
Sarah, whatever you may think...

1118
01:23:36,583 --> 01:23:40,031
...your only competition for my affections
is our little girI.

1119
01:23:40,199 --> 01:23:44,355
I love you. I will aIways love you
and you alone.

1120
01:23:46,310 --> 01:23:49,378
-You mean it today.
-AbsoIutely.

1121
01:23:50,183 --> 01:23:53,347
which makes it so much harder
when you don't.

1122
01:24:02,630 --> 01:24:05,250
Is that more shopping?
She does love the smell of money.

1123
01:24:05,415 --> 01:24:08,612
The little lady wants to go to the zoo,
so I thought you could take her.

1124
01:24:08,775 --> 01:24:11,743
Yeah? I mean,
I can do it tomorrow if not.

1125
01:24:11,910 --> 01:24:17,149
And Sarah, she knows.

1126
01:24:17,927 --> 01:24:21,026
She-- I mean, at least she knows
that something's not right...

1127
01:24:21,193 --> 01:24:24,508
...so if you can just do whatever you can
to heIp me with her.

1128
01:24:24,678 --> 01:24:28,455
TaIk to her. Just convince her
that I do love her.

1129
01:24:38,986 --> 01:24:42,846
-what is it, Freddy?
-Just don't call me that, please.

1130
01:24:43,016 --> 01:24:45,471
It's nothing. It's just, you know,
there's sometimes....

1131
01:24:45,639 --> 01:24:47,811
-Sometimes it seems wrong.
-I've told you before...

1132
01:24:47,976 --> 01:24:49,503
...when you're with me,
you're with me.

1133
01:24:49,672 --> 01:24:51,613
Leave your family at home
where they belong.

1134
01:24:52,232 --> 01:24:53,638
I'm trying.

1135
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:55,229
I'm trying, olivia.

1136
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:57,789
-I'll get dressed.
-Yeah.

1137
01:24:59,048 --> 01:25:01,797
I saw Fallon hanging around again.

1138
01:25:02,314 --> 01:25:04,354
There's something
about that man I don't trust.

1139
01:25:04,682 --> 01:25:07,363
You trust me? Then trust Fallon.

1140
01:25:07,848 --> 01:25:09,987
He protects the things that I care about.

1141
01:25:46,761 --> 01:25:48,966
we're sorry to see you go, Mr. Angier.

1142
01:25:49,129 --> 01:25:51,585
we were sorry to see
Mr. Tesla leave as well.

1143
01:25:51,754 --> 01:25:53,662
He was very good to colorado Springs.

1144
01:25:54,153 --> 01:25:59,849
Mr. Angier, I didn't think it was necessary
to tell Edison's men about the box.

1145
01:26:00,522 --> 01:26:01,469
what box?

1146
01:26:25,900 --> 01:26:29,096
I apologize for leaving
without saying goodbye...

1147
01:26:29,545 --> 01:26:33,541
...but I seem to have outstayed
my welcome in Colorado.

1148
01:26:34,282 --> 01:26:38,539
The truly extraordinary is not
permitted in science and industry.

1149
01:26:38,698 --> 01:26:43,915
Perhaps you"ll find more luck in your field,
where people are happy to be mystified.

1150
01:26:44,075 --> 01:26:47,816
You will find what
you are looking for in this box.

1151
01:26:48,234 --> 01:26:52,096
Alley has written you
a thorough set of instructions.

1152
01:26:52,268 --> 01:26:56,708
I add only one suggestion
on using the machine:

1153
01:26:56,874 --> 01:26:58,729
Destroy it.

1154
01:26:58,891 --> 01:27:01,860
Drop it to the bottom
of the deepest ocean.

1155
01:27:02,028 --> 01:27:05,094
Such a thing will bring you only misery.

1156
01:27:09,002 --> 01:27:12,385
Tesla"s warning is as unheeded
as he knew it would be.

1157
01:27:12,554 --> 01:27:14,411
Today, I tested the machine...

1158
01:27:14,570 --> 01:27:18,847
...taking precautions in case Tesla
hadn"t ironed out the kinks in its operation.

1159
01:27:19,019 --> 01:27:23,657
I mean, if it went wrong,
I would not wanna live like that for long.

1160
01:27:41,547 --> 01:27:45,410
But here at the Turn,
I must leave you, Borden.

1161
01:27:45,581 --> 01:27:47,653
Yes, you, Borden.

1162
01:27:47,821 --> 01:27:49,959
Sitting there in your cell...

1163
01:27:50,126 --> 01:27:53,988
...reading my diary, awaiting your death...

1164
01:27:54,157 --> 01:27:56,132
...for my murder.

1165
01:28:01,100 --> 01:28:04,199
Angier's journaI, that gesture
of good faith, that's a fake.

1166
01:28:04,364 --> 01:28:08,161
I assure you, it's not. The provenance
of the journaI is clear and under no doubt.

1167
01:28:08,333 --> 01:28:12,708
And it's written in Angier's own hand,
of which we had numerous examples.

1168
01:28:14,573 --> 01:28:16,298
It don't matter.

1169
01:28:18,284 --> 01:28:21,067
So my tricks.

1170
01:28:23,339 --> 01:28:26,854
-All of them.
-IncIuding The Transported Man?

1171
01:28:27,661 --> 01:28:29,865
well, Lord caldlow
will be very pleased indeed.

1172
01:28:30,029 --> 01:28:33,379
No, he won't.
Because they're not complete.

1173
01:28:33,550 --> 01:28:36,037
It's just the Pledge
and the Turn for each.

1174
01:28:36,206 --> 01:28:38,695
without the Prestige for these tricks...

1175
01:28:39,279 --> 01:28:41,514
-...these are worthless.
-Yeah.

1176
01:28:42,159 --> 01:28:45,476
You get the rest of it
when you bring my daughter here.

1177
01:28:48,237 --> 01:28:50,213
I wanna say goodbye.

1178
01:28:52,015 --> 01:28:53,292
we have to go through it now.

1179
01:28:53,453 --> 01:28:55,909
Listen, we have to go through it now.
Now, listen to me.

1180
01:28:56,077 --> 01:28:57,287
Deny it all you want.

1181
01:28:57,455 --> 01:28:59,657
olivia means nothing.

1182
01:28:59,823 --> 01:29:01,164
-olivia?
-I need an assistant.

1183
01:29:01,326 --> 01:29:02,407
No, I'll go to her.

1184
01:29:02,575 --> 01:29:04,201
-I'll tell her I know--
-Tell her what?

1185
01:29:04,367 --> 01:29:07,912
I know what you really are, AIfred. I....

1186
01:29:08,367 --> 01:29:10,222
-I know, and I--
-Sarah, Sarah.

1187
01:29:10,384 --> 01:29:12,552
-I can't keep it in.
-You can't taIk like this.

1188
01:29:12,718 --> 01:29:13,666
Sarah, shut up.

1189
01:29:13,838 --> 01:29:15,082
-No, no.
-Sarah, shut up!

1190
01:29:15,406 --> 01:29:16,967
I don't wanna hear it anymore!

1191
01:29:17,135 --> 01:29:20,037
You can't taIk like this!

1192
01:29:21,678 --> 01:29:24,615
You can't hide it anymore
because I know, AIfred, I know.

1193
01:29:24,782 --> 01:29:26,409
I know what you really are!

1194
01:29:26,575 --> 01:29:28,201
AIfred...

1195
01:29:28,367 --> 01:29:30,951
...I can't live like this.

1196
01:29:31,119 --> 01:29:33,007
oh, well, you think I can live like this?

1197
01:29:33,166 --> 01:29:36,166
You think I bloody enjoy living like this?

1198
01:29:36,334 --> 01:29:38,824
-Stop it and listen! No!
-we have this beautiful house...

1199
01:29:38,990 --> 01:29:42,122
...lovely little girI, we're married.
what is so wrong with your life?

1200
01:29:42,287 --> 01:29:44,676
AIfred, I can't live like this!

1201
01:29:44,942 --> 01:29:47,594
well, what do you want from me?

1202
01:29:52,049 --> 01:29:53,608
I want....

1203
01:29:53,776 --> 01:29:56,775
I want you to be honest with me.

1204
01:29:59,535 --> 01:30:01,324
No tricks...

1205
01:30:01,937 --> 01:30:05,198
...no lies...

1206
01:30:05,423 --> 01:30:08,458
...and no secrets.

1207
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:17,036
Do you--? Do you love me?

1208
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:21,418
Not today.

1209
01:30:23,376 --> 01:30:24,325
No.

1210
01:31:58,290 --> 01:32:00,199
who's there?

1211
01:32:02,225 --> 01:32:03,950
I'm looking for an old friend.

1212
01:32:04,113 --> 01:32:05,195
I heard about a booking.

1213
01:32:05,971 --> 01:32:08,556
Nice little theater.
Good up-and-coming magician.

1214
01:32:08,723 --> 01:32:10,927
-You're back.
-It's good to see you, John.

1215
01:32:11,827 --> 01:32:14,315
Good rehearsaI space.

1216
01:32:14,485 --> 01:32:17,004
Blind stagehands, I like it.

1217
01:32:17,172 --> 01:32:19,506
You aIways had
a good eye for publicity.

1218
01:32:19,668 --> 01:32:20,976
I need your heIp, John.

1219
01:32:21,493 --> 01:32:23,728
It's my last show. A limited engagement.

1220
01:32:24,147 --> 01:32:25,358
Your last show?

1221
01:32:25,876 --> 01:32:29,193
A wise man once told me
obsession was a young man's game.

1222
01:32:29,363 --> 01:32:30,311
I'm aImost done.

1223
01:32:31,250 --> 01:32:32,941
There's one thing left.

1224
01:32:33,972 --> 01:32:36,241
The ReaI Transported Man.

1225
01:32:38,068 --> 01:32:39,923
You wanna design a show around it.

1226
01:32:40,084 --> 01:32:42,767
I don't want you backstage.
I need you front of house, managing.

1227
01:32:42,934 --> 01:32:45,353
I need you to call in favors
or connections you have...

1228
01:32:45,524 --> 01:32:48,938
-...to get us the right booking for the run.
-what sort of booking you after?

1229
01:32:49,107 --> 01:32:51,246
The sort that Borden can't ignore.

1230
01:32:58,963 --> 01:33:00,939
what an honor it is to see you again, sir.

1231
01:33:01,108 --> 01:33:04,306
You told me you only wanted to show me
one trick. It piqued my interest.

1232
01:33:04,468 --> 01:33:07,402
-It's a very clever trick, Mr. Ackerman.
-Pleased to meet you.

1233
01:33:07,571 --> 01:33:10,290
Likewise, I'm sure.
well, let's get on, shall we?

1234
01:33:13,939 --> 01:33:15,884
Turn it on, gentlemen.

1235
01:33:20,564 --> 01:33:21,579
very pretty.

1236
01:33:32,309 --> 01:33:35,604
That's it, cutter? He simply disappears?

1237
01:33:35,765 --> 01:33:38,482
That's not a trick.
well, he has to come back.

1238
01:33:38,646 --> 01:33:39,660
There has to be a--

1239
01:33:39,831 --> 01:33:41,204
-A Prestige?
-Exactly.

1240
01:33:44,246 --> 01:33:45,969
Pardon me.

1241
01:33:46,708 --> 01:33:49,044
It's very rare to see...

1242
01:33:49,941 --> 01:33:51,797
...reaI magic.

1243
01:33:52,566 --> 01:33:56,080
-Yes, it's been many years since I've seen--
-Are you interested in heIping us?

1244
01:33:58,198 --> 01:33:59,603
Yes.

1245
01:34:00,180 --> 01:34:02,418
But you'll have to dress it up a little.

1246
01:34:03,990 --> 01:34:05,581
Disguise it.

1247
01:34:07,093 --> 01:34:09,461
Give them enough reason to doubt it.

1248
01:34:10,295 --> 01:34:13,361
You haven't spoken about her, Freddy.
Not once.

1249
01:34:13,527 --> 01:34:16,975
why would I taIk about her to you?

1250
01:34:17,143 --> 01:34:19,443
Because she was a part of your life.

1251
01:34:19,605 --> 01:34:20,718
And now she's gone.

1252
01:34:23,508 --> 01:34:27,634
You know, the day before she killed herseIf,
she said she wanted to meet me.

1253
01:34:27,926 --> 01:34:30,772
That she had something
to tell me about you.

1254
01:34:30,934 --> 01:34:34,130
I was such a coward,
I couldn't bring myseIf to face her.

1255
01:34:34,294 --> 01:34:35,888
But...

1256
01:34:37,046 --> 01:34:39,121
...what would she have said?

1257
01:34:39,287 --> 01:34:42,069
You wanna know the truth about me?

1258
01:34:43,159 --> 01:34:46,509
Truth is that...

1259
01:34:47,863 --> 01:34:49,773
...I never loved Sarah.

1260
01:34:51,416 --> 01:34:52,364
I never loved her.

1261
01:34:52,536 --> 01:34:55,732
-You married her. You had a child with her.
-Yes, yes. Part of me.

1262
01:34:55,893 --> 01:34:59,440
Part of me did, but the other part didn't.

1263
01:34:59,607 --> 01:35:02,805
The part that found you.
The part that's sitting here right now.

1264
01:35:03,895 --> 01:35:04,845
I love you.

1265
01:35:05,305 --> 01:35:08,565
No, olivia, I love you. That's the truth.

1266
01:35:08,728 --> 01:35:11,031
That is the truth that matters.

1267
01:35:11,191 --> 01:35:15,249
You could be in some other restaurant
with some other woman right now...

1268
01:35:15,415 --> 01:35:16,943
...taIking about me that way.

1269
01:35:17,111 --> 01:35:19,020
-No.
-Yes.

1270
01:35:22,264 --> 01:35:26,836
It's inhuman to be so cold.

1271
01:35:31,799 --> 01:35:35,443
He's back. After two years.

1272
01:35:35,606 --> 01:35:39,121
He's got a new trick. They're saying
it's the best London's ever seen.

1273
01:35:41,367 --> 01:35:44,628
You should see the look
on your face, Professor.

1274
01:35:45,559 --> 01:35:47,348
You should go to him.

1275
01:35:47,513 --> 01:35:49,782
You two deserve each other.

1276
01:35:54,682 --> 01:35:58,327
I'm afraid I'm booked. The Moscow Ballet,
they'll be playing through next year.

1277
01:35:58,489 --> 01:36:00,976
Then get rid of them.
There'll be a hundred performances.

1278
01:36:01,146 --> 01:36:02,771
No more, no less.

1279
01:36:02,938 --> 01:36:05,270
Five performances a week. No matinees.

1280
01:36:07,096 --> 01:36:09,912
And that's what you'll be charging
for each ticket. Good day.

1281
01:36:31,770 --> 01:36:34,157
Ladies and gentlemen,
my first trick of the evening...

1282
01:36:34,330 --> 01:36:36,883
...is one that invoIves considerable risk.

1283
01:36:37,306 --> 01:36:39,958
Anyone in the audience
who would be irrevocably damaged...

1284
01:36:40,121 --> 01:36:43,023
...by seeing a man drown
should leave now.

1285
01:36:43,193 --> 01:36:46,041
For when I tell you the young lady
who taught me this illusion...

1286
01:36:46,202 --> 01:36:47,728
...actually died performing it...

1287
01:36:47,896 --> 01:36:50,963
...you will understand the seriousness
of the dangers invoIved.

1288
01:36:53,115 --> 01:36:54,771
Let's begin.

1289
01:37:04,731 --> 01:37:07,960
In my traveIs, I have seen the future...

1290
01:37:09,050 --> 01:37:11,767
...and it is a strange future indeed.

1291
01:37:12,443 --> 01:37:14,418
The world, ladies and gentlemen...

1292
01:37:14,586 --> 01:37:19,671
...is on the brink of new
and terrifying possibilities.

1293
01:37:38,171 --> 01:37:42,424
what you're about to witness
is not magic.

1294
01:37:42,586 --> 01:37:43,993
It is purely science.

1295
01:37:44,378 --> 01:37:46,682
I would like to invite you
to come up on-stage now...

1296
01:37:46,842 --> 01:37:49,625
...so that you can examine the machine
for yourseIves.

1297
01:38:42,846 --> 01:38:45,879
Man's reach exceeds his imagination.

1298
01:38:46,045 --> 01:38:47,190
Bravo!

1299
01:38:50,045 --> 01:38:52,532
Bravo! Bravo!

1300
01:38:56,795 --> 01:38:59,252
Bravo. Bravo.

1301
01:39:07,164 --> 01:39:08,757
one hundred performances.

1302
01:39:08,924 --> 01:39:11,128
why? Does his method dictate that?

1303
01:39:11,292 --> 01:39:13,115
Is it a publicity move? what is it?

1304
01:39:13,275 --> 01:39:15,579
He's a no-talent magician,
and they're calling him...

1305
01:39:15,741 --> 01:39:17,748
...the bloody best in England. why?

1306
01:39:17,949 --> 01:39:20,501
Fifty yards in a second. In a second!

1307
01:39:20,669 --> 01:39:23,517
And all that we know
is he uses a trap door.

1308
01:39:23,678 --> 01:39:27,125
Brilliant. what is going on
under that stage?

1309
01:39:27,870 --> 01:39:30,553
why can't you outthink him?

1310
01:39:44,670 --> 01:39:46,131
They do this every night?

1311
01:39:46,303 --> 01:39:49,336
After each performance, yeah?

1312
01:40:18,494 --> 01:40:20,020
we're done.

1313
01:40:21,151 --> 01:40:22,525
All right?

1314
01:40:23,902 --> 01:40:25,462
Let him have his trick.

1315
01:40:25,631 --> 01:40:27,965
I don't need-- I don't need his secret.

1316
01:40:28,127 --> 01:40:29,620
So...

1317
01:40:30,943 --> 01:40:33,692
...don't go back there,
you leave him alone.

1318
01:40:33,887 --> 01:40:36,921
Both of us, just leave him alone.

1319
01:40:37,087 --> 01:40:38,495
we're done.

1320
01:40:47,073 --> 01:40:48,960
I told you, John...

1321
01:40:49,120 --> 01:40:50,975
...I don't want you backstage
on this one.

1322
01:40:52,768 --> 01:40:55,069
I would like to invite you
to come up on-stage now...

1323
01:40:55,229 --> 01:40:57,270
...so that you can examine the machine
for yourseIves.

1324
01:41:25,472 --> 01:41:29,334
-Hey, you, where do you think you're going?
-I'm part of the bloody act, you fooI.

1325
01:41:38,016 --> 01:41:39,707
who was that?

1326
01:42:33,985 --> 01:42:34,934
Hey!

1327
01:42:35,107 --> 01:42:38,456
where's the bloody key?
where's the bloody key?

1328
01:42:38,659 --> 01:42:40,798
The blind man's got it!

1329
01:42:40,964 --> 01:42:44,377
where's the bloody key?
Bloody drowning!

1330
01:42:53,377 --> 01:42:55,233
Hold on!

1331
01:42:59,490 --> 01:43:00,701
what have you done?

1332
01:43:21,731 --> 01:43:26,850
AIfred Borden, you have been found guiIty
of the murder of Robert Angier.

1333
01:43:27,012 --> 01:43:30,493
You will be hanged by the neck
untiI dead.

1334
01:43:31,267 --> 01:43:34,137
May the Lord have mercy on your soul.

1335
01:43:35,683 --> 01:43:37,406
Mr. cutter?

1336
01:43:38,115 --> 01:43:39,360
owens.

1337
01:43:40,036 --> 01:43:42,109
oh, thank you for coming, Mr. owens.

1338
01:43:42,274 --> 01:43:46,399
It has fallen to me to dispose
of Mr. Angier's equipment.

1339
01:43:46,564 --> 01:43:48,090
But I noticed from this manifest...

1340
01:43:48,259 --> 01:43:51,577
...that Lord caldlow
has purchased the bulk of the items.

1341
01:43:51,748 --> 01:43:55,523
Mr. cutter, if you needed to know
where to deliver these items, surely you--

1342
01:43:55,683 --> 01:43:58,848
No, no. It's just
there is one particular item...

1343
01:43:59,011 --> 01:44:02,874
...this item, in fact, that I would like to--

1344
01:44:03,043 --> 01:44:04,953
-You would like to...?
-Buy.

1345
01:44:05,125 --> 01:44:06,978
-Buy yourseIf?
-Yeah, I suppose so.

1346
01:44:08,164 --> 01:44:10,018
-This is the machine?
-Yes.

1347
01:44:10,180 --> 01:44:14,436
well, I'm afraid Lord caldlow was adamant
about purchasing this particular item.

1348
01:44:14,885 --> 01:44:17,471
Do you think I could taIk
to Lord caldlow in person?

1349
01:44:17,893 --> 01:44:20,196
out of the question, I'm afraid.

1350
01:44:22,630 --> 01:44:24,320
of course...

1351
01:44:24,485 --> 01:44:27,267
...I suppose if, in the course
of your delivery arrangements...

1352
01:44:27,430 --> 01:44:29,763
...your paths were to cross...

1353
01:44:30,178 --> 01:44:33,923
-...I can't stop you speaking your mind.
-Thank you.

1354
01:44:35,366 --> 01:44:37,471
-Still here, Borden?
-For now.

1355
01:44:38,181 --> 01:44:39,393
Got a visitor.

1356
01:44:39,558 --> 01:44:40,900
Lord caldlow.

1357
01:44:41,063 --> 01:44:43,037
with a little girI.

1358
01:44:51,204 --> 01:44:52,732
Jess?

1359
01:44:52,901 --> 01:44:54,330
Hello, my love.

1360
01:44:55,014 --> 01:44:57,763
How are you? I've missed you so much.

1361
01:44:57,925 --> 01:44:59,867
And Fallon's missed you too.
we both have.

1362
01:45:00,036 --> 01:45:02,176
Daddy, can I come in there?

1363
01:45:02,918 --> 01:45:05,187
Not right now. Not right now, darling.

1364
01:45:05,349 --> 01:45:08,731
No, but everything is gonna be all right.

1365
01:45:09,157 --> 01:45:11,711
-You must be Lord caldlow.
-caldlow.

1366
01:45:12,069 --> 01:45:13,116
Yes, I am.

1367
01:45:13,285 --> 01:45:14,398
I aIways have been.

1368
01:45:19,270 --> 01:45:21,310
They flatter you
with all those chains, AIfred.

1369
01:45:21,477 --> 01:45:24,326
Don't they know you can't escape
without your little rubber ball?

1370
01:45:24,487 --> 01:45:25,567
I pulled you out.

1371
01:45:25,736 --> 01:45:27,195
out of that tank.

1372
01:45:27,368 --> 01:45:30,880
All I wanted to do was prove
that I was a better magician...

1373
01:45:31,047 --> 01:45:32,836
...but you couldn't leave me alone.

1374
01:45:34,439 --> 01:45:36,544
I don't know what you've done...

1375
01:45:38,342 --> 01:45:41,689
...but you're not afraid
to get your hands dirty anymore, are you?

1376
01:45:41,862 --> 01:45:43,619
No, not anymore.

1377
01:45:43,783 --> 01:45:44,960
And I win.

1378
01:45:45,125 --> 01:45:48,193
Because no one cares about the man
in the box, the man who disappears.

1379
01:45:48,359 --> 01:45:49,308
You win?

1380
01:45:50,791 --> 01:45:55,015
This ain't a bloody competition anymore,
Angier, this is my little girI's life.

1381
01:45:55,175 --> 01:45:58,111
And don't you dare put her
in the middle of this.

1382
01:45:58,280 --> 01:46:00,995
oh, I know how hard it is
to have someone so speciaI...

1383
01:46:01,159 --> 01:46:03,679
...taken away from me, don't I, Borden?

1384
01:46:04,487 --> 01:46:07,007
And you can't take her with you now,
can you?

1385
01:46:07,174 --> 01:46:08,866
oh, she'll be looked after.

1386
01:46:09,385 --> 01:46:13,344
-Goodbye, Professor. come on, darling.
-No, no, no. Stop, stop, stop. Look.

1387
01:46:13,512 --> 01:46:14,757
Here.

1388
01:46:16,169 --> 01:46:17,825
That's what you're after.

1389
01:46:17,992 --> 01:46:19,999
That's what this is about.

1390
01:46:20,168 --> 01:46:21,377
Take it.

1391
01:46:21,544 --> 01:46:23,397
-Your secret?
-Yeah.

1392
01:46:26,280 --> 01:46:28,582
You aIways were the better magician.

1393
01:46:28,744 --> 01:46:30,172
we both know that.

1394
01:46:30,342 --> 01:46:33,889
But whatever your secret was,
I mean, you have to agree...

1395
01:46:34,119 --> 01:46:35,102
...mine is better.

1396
01:46:36,936 --> 01:46:40,003
Don't do this. Don't do this, Angier, no.
Jess, Jess, Jess.

1397
01:46:40,393 --> 01:46:43,426
Jess, I'm gonna take you home soon.
I promise.

1398
01:46:43,785 --> 01:46:45,956
-For God's sake, Borden.
-I promise. Look.

1399
01:46:49,769 --> 01:46:51,112
I promise.

1400
01:46:51,272 --> 01:46:54,752
-I love you, Jess. I love you.
-come on.

1401
01:46:54,919 --> 01:46:57,988
-come on. come on.
-I love you. I love you, Jess.

1402
01:46:58,153 --> 01:47:00,389
Angier. Angier!

1403
01:47:00,553 --> 01:47:02,463
what, you think this place can hold me?

1404
01:47:02,632 --> 01:47:05,382
Angier! They're gonna bloody hang me!

1405
01:47:05,545 --> 01:47:08,512
They're gonna bloody hang me!
You can put a stop to this now!

1406
01:47:08,682 --> 01:47:10,689
-Listen! Listen! That man--!
-Just shut up.

1407
01:47:10,857 --> 01:47:13,190
Listen, that man is the one
I'm meant to have killed!

1408
01:47:13,351 --> 01:47:15,207
You blind bastard, listen to me!

1409
01:47:15,368 --> 01:47:17,223
-If he's alive, I'm not guiIty!
-Guards!

1410
01:47:17,384 --> 01:47:19,457
-I'm not guiIty!
-I don't care! Get hold of him!

1411
01:47:19,626 --> 01:47:21,535
-Goodbye, Professor.
-Angier!

1412
01:47:26,089 --> 01:47:27,715
Run along now.

1413
01:47:28,651 --> 01:47:31,997
Sir. There's a gentleman waiting.

1414
01:47:47,209 --> 01:47:48,192
Dear God.

1415
01:47:48,971 --> 01:47:50,563
Hello, cutter.

1416
01:47:51,145 --> 01:47:52,969
You're-- You're still alive.

1417
01:47:53,131 --> 01:47:54,821
How is it you're still alive, Robert?

1418
01:47:55,050 --> 01:47:57,256
I saw you on a slab, for God's sake.

1419
01:48:00,394 --> 01:48:02,085
-child.
-Good night, sir.

1420
01:48:02,251 --> 01:48:03,680
Good night, Jess.

1421
01:48:05,417 --> 01:48:06,847
I've seen her before.

1422
01:48:07,017 --> 01:48:12,103
I saw her in court with Fallon.

1423
01:48:13,899 --> 01:48:16,288
-what have you done?
-well, she needs looking after.

1424
01:48:16,460 --> 01:48:18,629
She needs her father.

1425
01:48:19,019 --> 01:48:21,636
You're letting him hang,
and I heIped you.

1426
01:48:21,803 --> 01:48:27,466
I came here to beg Lord caldlow
to let me destroy that machine.

1427
01:48:27,980 --> 01:48:31,077
I am not gonna beg you for anything.

1428
01:48:31,242 --> 01:48:34,374
You don't have to. I'm gonna make sure
that machine's never used again.

1429
01:48:35,498 --> 01:48:39,557
Then, Lord caldlow...

1430
01:48:41,004 --> 01:48:42,857
...where do you want me to deliver it?

1431
01:48:43,018 --> 01:48:44,327
My theater.

1432
01:48:44,490 --> 01:48:46,531
It belongs with the Prestige materiaIs.

1433
01:48:47,148 --> 01:48:49,537
John, I tried not to invoIve you.

1434
01:49:01,996 --> 01:49:03,786
So...

1435
01:49:06,029 --> 01:49:08,002
...we go alone now.

1436
01:49:08,651 --> 01:49:10,440
Both of us.

1437
01:49:13,739 --> 01:49:17,036
only I don't have as far to go as you.

1438
01:49:22,060 --> 01:49:23,653
No.

1439
01:49:24,747 --> 01:49:27,976
You were right, I should have left him
to his damn trick.

1440
01:49:29,452 --> 01:49:31,144
I'm sorry.

1441
01:49:32,846 --> 01:49:35,146
I'm sorry for a lot of things.

1442
01:49:36,236 --> 01:49:38,276
I'm sorry about Sarah.

1443
01:49:39,916 --> 01:49:41,540
I didn't mean to hurt her.

1444
01:49:41,709 --> 01:49:43,564
I didn't.

1445
01:49:45,067 --> 01:49:47,655
You go live your life in full now, all right?

1446
01:49:47,820 --> 01:49:49,283
You live for both of us.

1447
01:49:57,644 --> 01:49:59,139
Goodbye.

1448
01:50:43,533 --> 01:50:45,259
Are you watching closely?

1449
01:51:15,407 --> 01:51:17,347
Put it down the end.

1450
01:51:49,553 --> 01:51:53,546
Take a minute to consider
your achievement.

1451
01:51:53,935 --> 01:51:58,858
I once told you about a sailor
who described drowning to me.

1452
01:51:59,025 --> 01:52:01,031
Yes, he said it was like going home.

1453
01:52:02,033 --> 01:52:06,732
I was lying. He said it was agony.

1454
01:52:43,890 --> 01:52:45,778
AIfred Borden...

1455
01:52:46,162 --> 01:52:49,739
...this day, in the name of the king
and the High court of England...

1456
01:52:49,905 --> 01:52:52,076
...you will meet your end.

1457
01:52:53,679 --> 01:52:56,463
No one cares about the man in the box.

1458
01:53:00,370 --> 01:53:01,931
cutter?

1459
01:53:06,449 --> 01:53:07,977
cutter?

1460
01:53:09,713 --> 01:53:12,975
Do you have anything to say?

1461
01:53:16,369 --> 01:53:17,775
Abracadabra.

1462
01:53:52,915 --> 01:53:54,573
A brother.

1463
01:53:54,738 --> 01:53:56,016
A twin.

1464
01:53:57,140 --> 01:54:02,223
You were Fallon the whole time.

1465
01:54:02,387 --> 01:54:03,468
No.

1466
01:54:04,437 --> 01:54:06,736
we were both Fallon.

1467
01:54:06,898 --> 01:54:07,913
And we were both Borden.

1468
01:54:13,812 --> 01:54:16,627
were you--? were you the one
who went into the box...

1469
01:54:16,787 --> 01:54:18,510
...or the one who came back out?

1470
01:54:19,731 --> 01:54:21,739
we took turns.

1471
01:54:26,419 --> 01:54:28,329
The trick is where we would swap.

1472
01:54:34,386 --> 01:54:38,666
cutter knew. cutter knew.
But I told him it was too simple, too easy.

1473
01:54:39,795 --> 01:54:41,354
No.

1474
01:54:42,066 --> 01:54:43,855
Simple maybe, but not easy.

1475
01:54:44,244 --> 01:54:47,625
There"s nothing easy
about two men sharing one life.

1476
01:54:53,077 --> 01:54:55,148
I don't understand
how it can be bleeding again.

1477
01:54:59,954 --> 01:55:02,030
what about olivia? And your wife?

1478
01:55:02,932 --> 01:55:04,821
we each loved one of them.

1479
01:55:08,373 --> 01:55:10,316
I loved Sarah.

1480
01:55:11,317 --> 01:55:13,455
He loved Olivia.

1481
01:55:13,909 --> 01:55:18,828
we each had haIf of a full life, really,
which was enough for us.

1482
01:55:18,996 --> 01:55:20,686
Just.

1483
01:55:22,389 --> 01:55:24,145
But not for them.

1484
01:55:26,676 --> 01:55:31,184
See, sacrifice, Robert,
that's the price of a good trick.

1485
01:55:33,590 --> 01:55:36,240
But you wouldn't know
anything about that, would you?

1486
01:55:39,572 --> 01:55:40,817
I've made sacrifices.

1487
01:55:40,980 --> 01:55:42,671
-No.
-Yes.

1488
01:55:43,252 --> 01:55:46,100
It takes nothing
to steaI another man's work.

1489
01:55:47,253 --> 01:55:48,782
It takes everything.

1490
01:56:08,053 --> 01:56:10,955
No. No.
No, wait! I'm the--!

1491
01:56:16,887 --> 01:56:18,894
It took courage.

1492
01:56:21,014 --> 01:56:24,014
It took courage to climb
into that machine every night...

1493
01:56:24,823 --> 01:56:29,578
...not knowing
if I'd be the man in the box...

1494
01:56:32,407 --> 01:56:33,355
...or in the Prestige.

1495
01:56:35,093 --> 01:56:39,536
Do you wanna--?
Do you wanna see what it cost me?

1496
01:56:39,992 --> 01:56:42,992
You didn't see where you are, did you?

1497
01:56:43,576 --> 01:56:45,682
Look. Look.

1498
01:56:46,681 --> 01:56:48,652
I don't care.

1499
01:56:52,790 --> 01:56:55,310
You went haIfway around the world.

1500
01:56:56,278 --> 01:56:59,095
You spent a fortune.

1501
01:57:00,888 --> 01:57:03,124
You did terrible things.

1502
01:57:04,215 --> 01:57:06,964
Really terrible things, Robert.

1503
01:57:08,631 --> 01:57:10,006
And all for nothing.

1504
01:57:11,191 --> 01:57:13,777
-For nothing?
-Yeah.

1505
01:57:17,017 --> 01:57:21,588
You never understood why we did this.

1506
01:57:24,376 --> 01:57:27,508
The audience knows the truth.

1507
01:57:28,090 --> 01:57:31,919
The world is simple. It's miserable.

1508
01:57:33,625 --> 01:57:36,013
Solid all the way through.

1509
01:57:37,880 --> 01:57:42,255
But if you could fooI them,
even for a second...

1510
01:57:43,767 --> 01:57:46,353
...then you could make them wonder.

1511
01:57:47,160 --> 01:57:48,916
And then you....

1512
01:57:49,337 --> 01:57:53,615
Then you got to see something
very speciaI.

1513
01:57:57,338 --> 01:57:59,506
You really don't know?

1514
01:58:03,032 --> 01:58:08,116
It was-- It was the look on their faces.

1515
01:58:22,681 --> 01:58:27,470
Every magic trick consists
of three parts or acts.

1516
01:58:30,615 --> 01:58:33,715
The first part is called the Pledge.

1517
01:58:34,104 --> 01:58:36,659
The magician shows you
something ordinary.

1518
01:58:37,784 --> 01:58:41,330
The second act is called the Turn.

1519
01:58:41,595 --> 01:58:44,561
The magician takes
the ordinary something...

1520
01:58:44,730 --> 01:58:47,546
...and makes it into
something extraordinary.

1521
01:58:48,795 --> 01:58:50,484
But you wouldn"t clap yet...

1522
01:58:50,652 --> 01:58:53,584
...because making something disappear
isn"t enough.

1523
01:58:54,203 --> 01:58:57,549
You have to bring it back.

1524
01:59:01,146 --> 01:59:02,739
Hey.

1525
01:59:29,594 --> 01:59:32,530
Now you"re looking for the secret.

1526
01:59:34,716 --> 01:59:39,418
But you won"t find it because,
of course, you"re not really looking.

1527
01:59:41,339 --> 01:59:44,305
You don"t really want to work it out.

1528
01:59:47,259 --> 01:59:49,463
You want to be fooled.

1529
02:01:20,776 --> 02:01:29,078
THE END
