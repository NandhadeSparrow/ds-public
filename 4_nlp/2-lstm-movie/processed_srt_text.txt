BRUCE: Rachel, let me see.
In my garden.
Finders keepers.
Bruce?
Bruce?
Mom!
Mr.
AIfred!
Did you have dream?
Nightmare.
Worse than this place?
LANGUAGE OVER P.A.] MAN [WHISPERS]: They are going to fight you.
Can they kill me before breakfast?
You are in hell, little man.
And I am the devil.
You're not the devil.
You're practice.
GUARD: Solitary.
Get in.
DUCARD: Are you so desperate to fight criminaIs...
to take them on one at a time?
Actually, there were seven of them.
I counted six, Mr.
Wayne.
How do you know my name?
The world is too small for someone like Bruce Wayne to disappear...
he chooses to sink.
Who are you?
My name is merely Ducard, but I speak for Ra's al Ghul...
by the criminal underworld.
A man who can offer you a path.
What makes you think I need a path?
Someone like you is only here by choice.
You have been exploring the criminal fraternity...
your original intentions...
And what path can Ra's al Ghul offer?
The path of a man who shares his hatred of evil...
The path of the League of Shadows.
A vigilante is just a man lost in the scramble for his own gratification.
He can be destroyed or locked up.
But if you make yourseIf more than just a man...
something eIse entirely.
Which is?
Legend, Mr.
Wayne.
Tomorrow, you will be released.
If you are bored of brawling with thieves and want to achieve something...
that grows on the eastern slopes.
Pick one of these flowers.
If you can carry it to the top of the mountain...
looking for in the first place.
And what was I looking for?
Only you can know that.
You turn back.
You go back.
BRUCE: Ra's al Ghul?
DUCARD: Wait.
What are you seeking?
I seek...
To turn fear...
who prey on the fearful.
DUCARD [TRANSLATING]: To manipulate the fears in others...
Are you ready to begin?
I can....
I can barely stand.
Death does not wait for you to be ready!
Death is not considerate or fair!
And make no mistake, here you face death.
Tiger.
Jujitsu.
Panther.
You're skilled.
But this is not a dance.
And you are afraid.
But not of me.
Tell us, Mr.
Wayne...
Bruce?
It's okay.
It's okay.
You'll be okay.
ALFRED: Will we be needing an ambulance, Master Wayne?
THOMAS: No, I'll set the bone and take him for an x-ray later.
ALFRED: Very good, sir.
THOMAS: Don't worry.
It's fine.
ALFRED: Took quite a fall, didn't we, Master Bruce?
THOMAS: And why do we fall?
So we can learn to pick ourselves up.
Just a little fall.
It's just a small fracture.
THOMAS: The bats again?
You know why they attacked you, don't you?
All creatures feel fear.
Even the scary ones?
Especially the scary ones.
I got something to show you.
THOMAS: No going back to bed.
Did you build this train, Dad?
Gotham's been good to our family, but the city's been suffering.
People less fortunate than us have been enduring very hard times.
So we buiIt a new, cheap, public transportation system to unite the city.
And at the center...
BRUCE: Is that where you work?
I leave the running of our company to much better men.
Can we go?
Please.
Okay.
Let's go.
I just needed some fresh air.
A little bit of opera goes a long way.
Right, Bruce?
Come on.
Let's go.
Wallets, jewelry.
Come on, fast.
THOMAS: That's fine.
CHILL: Fast.
Take it easy.
Here you go.
It's fine.
It's fine.
Now just take it and go.
THOMAS: Hey-- MARTHA: Thomas!
THOMAS [WHISPERING]: Bruce.
It's okay.
Don't be afraid.
Is this your father's?
It's okay.
Come here.
There you go.
It's okay.
LOEB: Gordon.
Hey.
Good news.
We got him, son.
You're in excellent hands.
We'll be watching the empire.
When you grow up, it'll be waiting for you.
I thought I might prepare a little supper.
It was him, and him alone.
Do you understand?
I miss them, AIfred.
I miss them so much.
So do l, Master Bruce.
So do l.
DUCARD: And do you still feel responsible for your parents' death?
My anger outweighs my guiIt.
Come.
You have learned to bury your guiIt with anger.
I will teach you to confront it and to face the truth.
You know how to fight six men.
We can teach you how to engage 600.
You know how to disappear.
We can teach you to become truly invisible.
Invisible?
The ninja understands that invisibility is a matter of patience and agility.
Always mind your surroundings.
Ninjitsu employs explosive powders.
Theatricality and deception are powerful agents.
You must become more than just a man in the mind of your opponent.
FOREIGN LANGUAGE] BRUCE: Who is he?
Then he tried to take his neighbor's land and became a murderer.
Justice.
Crime cannot be tolerated.
CriminaIs thrive on the indulgence of society's understanding.
Your parents' death was not your fauIt.
It was your father's.
Anger does not change the fact that your father failed to act.
I've had training.
The training is nothing!
Will is everything!
The will to act.
Yield.
You haven't beaten me.
You have sacrificed sure footing for a killing stroke.
DUCARD: Rub your chest.
Your arms will take care of themselves.
You are stronger than your father.
You didn't know my father.
But I know the rage that drives you.
That impossible anger strangling the grief...
of your loved one is just...
And one day, you catch yourseIf wishing the person you loved had never existed...
I wasn't always here in the mountains.
Once, I had a wife.
My great love.
She was taken from me.
Like you, I was forced to learn there are those without decency...
without hesitation, without pity.
Your anger gives you great power.
But if you let it, it will destroy you...
That's no help to me.
Why, Bruce?
Why could you not avenge your parents?
Will you be heading back to Princeton after the hearing, sir...
for a day or two?
BRUCE: I'm not heading back at all.
ALFRED: You don't like it there?
They just don't feel the same way.
My room will be fine.
ALFRED: With all due respect, sir, Wayne Manor is your house.
BRUCE: No, AIfred, it's my father's house.
If I have my way, I'll pull the damn thing down brick by brick.
This house, Master Wayne, has sheItered six generations of your family.
Why do you give a damn, AIfred?
It's not your family.
I give a damn because a good man once made me responsible...
Miss Dawes has offered to drive you to the hearing.
She probably hopes to talk you out of going.
BRUCE: Should I just bury the past out there with my parents, AIfred?
I wouldn't presume to tell you what to do with your past, sir.
Just know that there are those of us who care about what you do with your future.
Haven't given up on me yet?
Never.
AIfred still keeps the condensed milk on the top sheIf.
Hasn't he noticed you're tall enough to reach now?
Old habits die hard, I guess.
How's your mom?
She misses this place.
So do l.
Yeah.
But it's nothing without the people who made it what it was.
Bruce, I don't suppose there's any way to convince you not to come.
Someone at this proceeding...
We all loved your parents, Bruce.
In prison, he shared a cell with Carmine Falcone.
He learned things, and he will testify in exchange for early parole.
Rachel, this man killed my parents.
I cannot let that pass.
And I need you to understand that, please.
Okay.
FINCH: The depression hit working people, like Mr.
Chill, hardest of all.
His crime was appalling, yes, but it was motivated not by greed...
Given the 14 years served, as well as his extraordinary level of cooperation...
most important investigations...
for early release.
FADEN: Mr.
Chill?
CHILL: Your Honor...
I could take back what I did.
Sure, I was desperate, like a lot of people back then...
FADEN: I gather there is a member of the Wayne family here today.
Has he got anything to say?
WOMAN 1: He's coming out the side!
MAN 1 : He's coming out the side, guys!
MAN 2: Bruce Wayne!
WOMAN 2: Joe!
Hey, Joe!
Falcone says hi.
RACHEL: Come on, Bruce.
We don't need to see this.
I do.
RACHEL: The DA couldn't understand why Judge Faden insisted...
Falcone paid him off to get Chill out in the open.
Maybe I should thank them.
My parents deserved justice.
You're not talking about justice.
You're talking about revenge.
Justice is about harmony.
Revenge is about you making yourseIf feel better.
AND HORNS HONKlNG] You care about justice?
Look beyond your own pain, Bruce.
This city is rotting.
They talk about the depression as if it's history.
It's not.
Things are worse than ever here.
Falcone floods our streets with crime and drugs...
creating new Joe ChilIs every day.
Falcone may not have killed your parents, Bruce...
that they stood for.
You wanna thank him for that?
Here you go.
We all know where to find him.
As long as he keeps the bad people rich...
no one'll touch him.
Good people like your parents, who'll stand against injustice, they're gone.
What chance does Gotham have when the good people do nothing?
All these years, I wanted to kill him.
Now I can't.
Your father would be ashamed of you.
You're taller than you look in the tabloids, Mr.
Wayne.
No gun?
I'm insuIted.
I came to show you that not everyone in Gotham's afraid of you.
Only those who know me, kid.
Look around you.
You'll see two councilmen...
couple off-duty cops...
I wouldn't have a second's hesitation of blowing your head off in front of them.
Now, that's power you can't buy.
That's the power of fear.
I'm not afraid of you.
Because you think you got nothing to lose.
But you haven't thought it through.
You haven't thought about your lady friend in the DA's office.
You haven't thought about your old butler.
Bang!
People from your world...
Now, you think because your mommy and your daddy got shot...
but you don't.
You've never tasted desperate.
You're....
You're Bruce Wayne, the prince of Gotham.
You'd have to go 1000 miles to meet someone who didn't know your name.
So don't come here with your anger, trying to prove something to yourseIf.
This is a world you'll never understand.
And you always fear...
All right.
Yeah, you got spirit, kid.
I'll give you that.
More than your old man anyway.
In the joint, Chill told me about the night he killed your parents.
He said your father begged for mercy.
Begged.
Like a dog.
Should've tipped better.
Okay.
Hey, hey, hey.
Let me have it.
It's a nice coat.
Be careful who sees you with that.
BRUCE: Everyone.
It's....
It's a nice coat.
the criminaIs, did you start to pity them?</i> so that I wouldn't starve, yes.</i> the simple nature of right and wrong.</i> But I never became one of them.</i> OFFICER 2: Fool.
What do I care what your name is?
You're a criminal.
I'm not a criminal OFFICER 2: Tell that to the guy who owned these.
to understand the criminal mind...</i> But a criminal is not complicated.
And what you really fear is inside yourseIf.
You fear your own power.
You fear your anger...
or terrible things.
Now you must journey inwards.
You are ready.
Breathe.
Breathe in your fears.
Face them.
To conquer fear, you must become fear.
You must bask in the fear of other men.
And men fear most what they cannot see.
You have to become a terrible thought.
A wraith.
You have to become an idea!
Feel terror cloud your senses.
Feel its power to distort.
To control.
And know that this power can be yours.
Embrace your worst fear.
Become one with the darkness.
Focus.
Concentrate.
Master your senses.
You cannot leave any sign.
BRUCE: I haven't.
Impressive.
DUCARD [TRANSLATING]: We have purged your fear.
You are ready to lead these men.
You are ready to become a member of the League of Shadows.
But first, you must demonstrate your commitment to justice.
No.
I'm no executioner.
DUCARD: Your compassion is a weakness your enemies will not share.
That's why it's so important.
It separates us from them.
You want to fight criminaIs.
This man is a murderer.
DUCARD: By whom?
Corrupt bureaucrats?
CriminaIs mock society's laws.
You know this better than most.
RA'S A GHUL: You cannot lead these men...
what is necessary to defeat evil.
And where would I be leading these men?
Gotham.
As Gotham's favored son...
to strike at the heart of criminality.
Like Constantinople or Rome before it...
for suffering and injustice.
It is beyond saving and must be allowed to die.
This is the most important function of the League of Shadows.
It is one we've performed for centuries.
Gotham...
You can't believe in this.
Ra's al Ghul rescued us from the darkest corners of our own hearts.
What he asks in return is the courage to do what is necessary.
I will go back to Gotham and I will fight men like this...
Bruce, please.
For your own sake, there is no turning back.
I will tell him you saved his life.
Master Wayne, you've been gone a long time.
Apart from the mud.
Are you coming back to Gotham for long, sir?
As long as it takes.
I want to show the people...
to the criminaIs and the corrupt.
In the depression, your father nearly bankrupted Wayne Enterprises...
He believed his example could inspire the weaIthy of Gotham to save their city.
Did it?
In a way.
Their murder shocked the weaIthy and the powerful into action.
People need dramatic examples to shake them out of apathy.
I can't do that as Bruce Wayne.
As a man...
I can be ignored, destroyed.
But as a symbol....
As a symbol, I can be incorruptible.
Something elemental...
I assume that as you take on the underworld...
those you care about from reprisaIs?
You're thinking about Rachel?
Actually, sir, I was thinking of myseIf.
Have you told anyone I'm coming back?
I couldn't figure the legal ramifications of bringing you back from the dead.
You had me declared dead?
Actually, it was Mr.
Earle.
He's taking the company public.
He wanted to liquidate your majority shareholding.
Those shares are worth quite a bit of money.
Well, it's a good thing I left everything to you, then.
Quite so, sir.
And you can borrow the RolIs, if you like.
Just bring it back with a full tank.
In my opinion, Mr.
Zsaz is as much a danger to himseIf as to others...
environment for his rehabilitation.
You think a man who butchers people for the mob doesn't belong in jail?
I would hardly have testified to that otherwise, would I?
This is the third of Falcone's thugs you've had declared insane...
The work offered by organized crime must have an attraction to the insane.
Or the corrupt.
Mr.
Finch.
You should check with Miss Dawes here...
has authorized her to make.
If any.
FINCH: Looking out for you.
Falcone has haIf the city bought and paid for.
Because as much as I care about getting Falcone, I care more about you.
That's sweet.
We've been through all that.
ALFRED: Blessed bat again, sir.
They nest somewhere in the grounds.
No more favors.
Someone is sniffing around.
Hey, I scratch your back, you scratch mine, doc.
I'm bringing in the shipments.
We are paying you for that.
Maybe money isn't as interesting to me as favors.
I am more than aware that you are not intimidated by me, Mr.
Falcone.
But you know who I'm working for, and when he gets here-- He-- He's coming to Gotham?
Yes, he is.
And when he gets here, he's not going to wanna hear...
just to get your thugs out of jail time.
Idealist, huh?
Well, there's an answer to that too.
MAN: No, we are showing very heaIthy growth in these sectors.
I don't think Thomas Wayne would have viewed heavy-arms manufacture...
for our business.
Well, that's 20 years ago, Fredericks.
I think after 20 years we can allow ourselves...
Thomas Wayne would have done.
JESSlCA: Good morning, Mr.
Earle's office.
Yes, he's confirmed for the dinner tomorrow evening.
BRUCE: Good morning.
I'm here to see Mr.
Earle.
Name?
Bruce Wayne.
Thomas would probably not have taken the company public.
But that is what we, as responsible managers, are going to do.
Jessica?
Jessica?
Where are you?
BRUCE: Eye on the ball, and....
It's Wayne Enterprises, Mr.
Earle.
I'm sure they'll call back.
Bruce?
You're supposed to be dead.
I'm sorry to disappoint.
It's been all over the news.
He's back.
EARLE: I'm sure you realize I can't stop the big machine.
Too many wheeIs turning.
And I'll be handsomely rewarded for my shares.
I'm not looking to interfere.
I just want to get to know the company that my family buiIt.
Any ideas where you would start?
Applied Sciences caught my eye.
Fox's department.
I'll let him know you're coming.
You look like him.
Your dad.
You're the only one left of the Wayne family.
This is where you belong.
Welcome home.
Environmental procedures, defense projects, consumer products.
All prototypes.
None in production.
What did they tell you this place was?
BRUCE: They didn't tell me anything.
Earle told me exactly what it was when he sent me down here.
Dead end.
Place to keep me from causing the board any more trouble.
Come on.
Helped him build his train.
Here we are.
Kevlar utility harness.
Gas-powered, magnetic grapple gun.
The 350-pound test monofilament.
Wonderful project, your dad's train.
Routed it right into Wayne Tower, along with the water and power utilities.
Kind of made Wayne Tower the unofficial center of Gotham City.
Of course, Earle let it go to rot.
Here we are.
Nomex survival suit for advanced infantry.
Kevlar biweave, reinforced joints.
So, what's your interest in it, Mr.
Wayne?
I want to borrow it.
For spelunking.
Spelunking?
Yeah, you know, cave diving?
You expecting to run into much gunfire in these caves?
Look, I'd rather Mr.
Earle didn't know about me borrowing-- Mr.
Wayne...
Okay.
Give it a try.
Charming.
At least you'll have company.
This must be the lowest foundation of the southeast wing.
Your great-great-grandfather was involved in the Underground Railroad...
to the North...
came in handy.
AIfred!
Come up here!
I can see everything all right from down here, sir, thank you.
ALFRED: We order the main part of this cowl from Singapore.
BRUCE: Via a dummy corporation.
Indeed.
And then, quite separately...
to a Chinese company for these.
They'll have to be large orders, to avoid suspicion.
OVER POLlCE RADIO] Don't suppose you want a taste.
I just keep offering, thinking maybe someday you'll get wise.
There's nothing wise in what you do, Flass.
Well, Jimbo, you don't take the taste, makes us guys nervous.
I'm no rat.
In a town this bent, who's there to rat to anyway?
BATMAN: Don't turn around.
You're a good cop.
One of the few.
GORDON: What do you want?
BATMAN: Carmine Falcone brings in shipments of drugs every week.
Nobody takes him down.
Why?
He's paid up with the right people.
What will it take to bring him down?
Leverage on Judge Faden...
to prosecute.
Rachel Dawes.
Who are you?
BATMAN: Watch for my sign.
You're just one man?
BATMAN: Now we're two.
We?
Freeze!
OFFICER: What the hell was that?
Just some nut.
Well, what is it today?
More spelunking?
No.
Today it's BASE-jumping.
BASE-jumping.
Do you have any lightweight fabrics?
You know, I think I have just the thing.
It's called memory cloth.
Notice anything?
Regularly flexible...
Can be tailored to fit any structure based on a rigid skeleton.
Too expensive for the Army?
I don't think they tried to market it to the billionaire, BASE-jumping crowd.
If you're uncomfortable-- Mr.
Wayne, if you don't want to tell me exactly what you're doing...
But don't think of me as an idiot.
Fair enough.
What's that?
The Tumbler?
Oh, you wouldn't be interested in that.
She was buiIt as a bridging vehicle.
During combat, two of these would jump over a river, towing cables.
Over here on the throttle, flip that open and throttle up.
This will boost you into a rampless jump-- Not now!
Not-- Not now, sir.
Afterburner disengaged.</i> We never could get the damn bridge to work...
So, what do you think?
Does it come in black?
I need you at the docks Thursday.
Word on the street is you got a beef with somebody in the DA's office.
to do anything about it.
So, what's your point, Mr.
Flass?
Have you seen the girl?
It's a cute little assistant DA.</i> heat to bring down, maybe?</i> People get mugged coming home from work every day of the week.
Sometimes-- Sometimes things just go bad.
It's a problem with the graphite, sir.
The next 10,000 will be up to specifications.
In the meantime, sir, may I suggest you try to avoid landing on your head?
Why bats, Master Wayne?
Bats frighten me.
It's time my enemies shared my dread.
FLASS: What is this?
Continue.
Looks fine out there.
The bears go straight to the dealers.
Yeah, and the rabbits go to the man in the Narrows.
Don't burden yourseIf with the secrets of scary people.
Hey.
Steiss.
Steiss?
MAN: What?
What the...?
I better check it.
There's a problem out here.
You better bail.
Where are you?!
Here.
Take a ride.
Oh, shit.
What the hell are you?
I'm Batman.
Nice coat.
Thanks.
Hold it.
That's right, you better run.
Falcone sent them to kill you.
Who are you?
Someone like you.
Someone who'll rattle the cages.
Ma'am?
Everything okay?
OFFICER: Falcone's men?
We'll never tie him to it anyway.
I wouldn't be too sure of that.
What the hell is that?
Cut him down.
LOEB: Unacceptable.
Now, I don't care if it's rival gangs, Guardian AngeIs...
and off the front page.
They say it was just one guy.
Or a creature.
It was some asshole in a costume.
No one takes the law into their own hands in my city.
Understand?
RACHEL: No way to bury it now.
FINCH: There's still Judge Faden.
Even if these guys will swear to being thrashed by a giant bat...
Drugs, prints, cargo manifests.
This bat character gave us everything.
Okay.
Let's do it.
ALFRED: Bats may be.
But even for billionaire playboys, The price for leading a double life, I fear.
Your theatrics made an impression.
BRUCE: Theatricality and deception...
This is a good start.
If those are to be the first of many injuries to come...
to find a suitable excuse.
Polo, for instance.
I'm not learning polo, AIfred.
Strange injuries, a nonexistent social life.
These things beg the question...
do with his time and his money.
What does someone like me do?
Drive sports cars, date movie stars.
Buy things that are not for sale.
Who knows, Master Wayne, you start pretending to have fun...
by accident.
MAN: Sir.
The Coast Guard picked up one of our cargo ships last night...
probably dead.
a prototype weapon.</i> It's designed for desert warfare, but it-- It looks like somebody...
It uses focused microwaves to vaporize the enemy's water supply.
was catastrophic.</i> The weapon itseIf is....
Missing?
Yeah.
MAN: Mr.
Wayne.
Nice car.
You should see my other one.
WOMAN: He's done something the police never have.
MAN: You can't take the law into your own hands.
Well, at least he's getting something done.
MAN: Bruce, help me out here.
Well, a guy who dresses up like a bat clearly has issues.
But he's put Falcone behind bars.
MAN: Now the cops want him.
What does that tell you?
They're jealous.
Sir, the pool is for decoration...
do not have swimwear.
Well, they're European.
I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
about the pool area.
I think the Batman deserves a medal.
And a straitjacket to pin it on.
MAN: Thank you.
Bruce?
Rachel?
I'd heard you were back.
What are you doing?
Just swimming here.
Wow, it is good to see you.
You were gone a long time.
Job's getting worse.
Can't change the world on your own.
What choice do I have...
Rachel, all of-- All this....
It's-- It's not me.
It's....
Inside, I am....
I am more.
WOMAN 1: Come on, Bruce.
Come on.
WOMAN 2: Bruce, we have some more hoteIs for you to buy.
Bruce...
that same great kid you used to be.
But it's not who you are underneath...
WOMAN: Dr.
Crane, thanks for coming.
Not at all.
He cut his wrists?
Probably looking for the insanity plea.
But if anything should happen....
Of course, better safe than sorry.
Yeah, Dr.
Crane, I can't take it anymore.
It's all too much.
The walIs are closing in.
Blah, blah, blah.
A couple of days of this food, it'll be true.
to keep my mouth shut.
About what?
You don't know anything.
I know you don't want the cops to take a closer look at the drugs they seized.
And I know about your experiments with the inmates of your nut house.
See, I don't go into business with a guy without finding out his dirty secrets.
And those goons you used.
I own the muscle in this town.
Now, I've been bringing your stuff in for months...
it's big, and I want in.
Well, I already know what he'll say.
That we should kill you.
Even he can't get me in here.
Not in my town.
Would you like to see my mask?
I use it in my experiments.
Now, I'm probably not very frightening to a guy like you.
But these crazies, they can't stand it.
So when did the nut take over the nut house?
SCARECROW: They scream and they cry...
Well, he's not faking.
Not that one.
I'll talk to the judge and see if I can get him moved...
I can't treat him here.
BATMAN: Storm's coming.
The scum is getting jumpy because you stood up to Falcone.
It's a start.
Your partner was at the docks with Falcone.
Well, he moonlights as a low-level enforcer.
They were splitting the shipment in two.
Only haIf went to the dealers.
Why?
What about the other haIf?
He'll talk to me.
GORDON: Commissioner Loeb set up a massive task force to catch you.
I think you're trying to help.
But I've been wrong before.
FLASS: Come on, I ain't got all night.
Flass, I have kids to feed.
What, they don't like falafel?
Where were the other drugs going?
I never knew.
I don't know.
I don't-- I don't know.
I never knew.
Never.
They went to some guy for a couple days before they went to the dealers.
Why?
There was something-- Something eIse in the drugs...
I never went to the drop-off point.
It was in the Narrows.
No--!
FINCH: This is the one I'm talking about.
This ship left Singapore with I'm guessing there's something I'm not supposed to find in there.
Listen, counselor, we don't wanna know what's in Mr.
Falcone's crate.
Things are working a little differently now.
Open it up.
FINCH: What the hell is this?
It's you, isn't it?
Everybody's been talking about you.
MAN: Get in here!
The other kids won't believe me.
Get rid of all traces.
MAN: Better torch the whole place.
CRANE: All right.
SCARECROW: Having trouble?
Take a seat.
Have a drink.
You look like a man who takes himseIf too seriously.
Do you want my opinion?
You need to lighten up.
AIfred, help me.
Blood.
Take.
Take poison.
Blood poison.
Poisonous.
Poisonous.
Bruce...</i> It's your birthday.
Many happy returns.
I've feIt these effects before, but this was so much more potent.
It was some kind of hallucinogen, weaponized, in aerosol form.
You have been hanging out in the wrong clubs, Mr.
Wayne.
I called Mr.
Fox when your condition worsened after the first day.
FOX: I analyzed your blood...
and the protein-based catalyst.
Am I meant to understand any of that?
Not at all.
I just wanted you to know how hard it was.
You planning on gassing yourseIf again, Mr.
Wayne?
Well, you know how it is.
You're out at night, looking for kicks...
the weaponized hallucinogens....
I'll bring what I have.
The antidote should inoculate you for now.
AIfred, always a pleasure.
Lucius.
BRUCE: Rachel?
RACHEL: Looks like someone's been burning the candle at both ends.
I know.
I'm sorry I can't come tonight.
I was just dropping off your present.
probably start by looking...
RACHEL: Excuse me.
Rachel Dawes.
Who authorized that?
Get Crane down there now.
Don't take no for an answer.
Call Dr.
Lehmann, tell him we need our own assessment to the judge by morning.
Dr.
Crane moved him to Arkham Asylum on suicide watch.
You're going to Arkham now?
It's in the Narrows, Rachel.
You enjoy your party, Bruce.
Happy birthday.
But, Master Wayne, the guests will be arriving.
Keep them happy until I arrive.
Tell them that joke you know.
EARLE: Having fun?
Bill?
Now, what's a big shot like you doing in a place like this?
I need some information.
The Wayne Enterprise 47-B, 1-ME.
It's a microwave emitter.
It was designed to vaporize an enemy's water supply.
Rumor was they tested dispersing water-based chemicaIs into the air...
I want all the information on the development of this project...
on my desk right away.
Did you lose one?
I'm merging your department with Archives.
And I am firing you.
Didn't you get the memo?
FALCONE: Scarecrow.
Scarecrow.
Miss Dawes, this is most irregular.
I have nothing to add to the report I filed with the judge.
Isn't it convenient for a 52-year-old man who has no history of mental illness...
just when he's about to be indicted?
As you can see for yourseIf, there is nothing convenient about his symptoms.
Patients suffering delusional episodes often focus their paranoia...
to Jungian archetypes.
In this case, a scarecrow.
I'm a strong advocate.</i> In here, only the mind can grant you power.
You enjoy the reversal.
I respect the mind's power over the body.
It's why I do what I do.
I do what I do to keep thugs like Falcone behind bars, not in therapy.
I want my own psychiatric consuItant to have full access to Falcone...
Find out what exactly you put him on.
I've already paged Dr.
Lehmann at County General.
CRANE: As you wish.
This way, please.
There's something I think you should see.
This is where we make the medicine.
Perhaps you should have some, clear your head.
Who knows you're here?
Who knows?
He's here.
MAN 1: Who?
The Batman.
MAN 1: What do we do?
At this point, they can't stop us.
But the Batman has a talent for disruption.
Force him outside, the police will take him down.
Go.
MAN 1: What about her?
CRANE: She hasn't got long.
I gave her a concentrated dose.
The mind can only take so much.
Now go.
MAN 2: The things they say about him.
Can he really fly?
MAN 3: I heard he can disappear.
Well, we'll find out.
Won't we?
Taste of your own medicine, doctor?
What have you been doing here?
Who are you working for?
Ra's-- Ra's al Ghul.
Ra's al Ghul is dead.
Who are you working for?
Crane.
Dr.
Crane isn't here right now.
But if you'd like to make an appointment....
OFFICER [OVER P.A.]: Batman, put down your weapons and surrender.
You're surrounded.
SWAT's on the way.
But if you wanna go in now...
SWAT's on the way.
GORDON: What's happened to her?
Crane poisoned her with a psychotropic hallucinogen, a panic-inducing toxin.
Get her downstairs.
Meet me in the alley.
Crane's been smuggling his toxin hidden in Falcone's drugs...
into the water supply.
Was he working for Falcone?
He mentioned someone eIse, someone worse.
She needs the antidote before the damage is permanent.
What is that?
Excuse me.
BATMAN: How is she?
I'll get my car.
BATMAN: I brought mine.
Yours?
I've gotta get me one of those.
OFFICER 1: He is in a vehicle.
Make and color?</i> It's a black...
Stay calm.
You've been poisoned.
I'm on him.
Breathe slowly.
Hold on.
Air One to ground, block that ramp.</i> Turn off your engine.
Step away from the car.
COMPUTER: Weapons system activated.
Who is this guy?
Where's he going?</i> He's on the roof.
OFFICER 2: What street is he taking?
He's flying on rooftops.
At least tell me what it looks like.
Never mind.
Got him.
Coming right up on his butt.
vehicle heading west on I-17.</i> We've lost visual.
Exit 9 is blocked.</i> the frontage road.</i> Stealth mode activated.</i> Stay with me.
What--?
There he is.
Just hold on.
Rachel!
GORDON: They get any of this into the mains?
OFFICER: Yeah.
Notify the water company.
There's gotta be a way to isolate it.
No.
They put it all in.
They must've been at this for weeks.
Must be a compound that has to be absorbed through the lungs.
BATMAN: How do you feel?
Where are we?
Is Sergeant Gordon your friend?
I don't have the luxury of friends.
I'm gonna give you a sedative.
You'll wake up back at home.
When you do, get these to Gordon, and Gordon alone.
Trust no one.
One for Gordon to inoculate himseIf, the other for mass production.
RACHEL: Mass production?
Crane was just a pawn.
We need to be ready.
When you told me your grand plan for saving Gotham...
from calling the men in white coats...
it wasn't about thrill-seeking.
I didn't have time to observe the rules of the road, AIfred.
You're getting lost inside this monster of yours.
I'm using this monster to help other people, just like my father did.
For Thomas Wayne, helping others...
to anyone, including himseIf.
It's Rachel, AIfred.
She was dying.
She's downstairs, sedated.
I need you to take her home.
Well, we both care for Rachel, but what you're doing has to be beyond that.
It can't be personal, or you're just a vigilante.
We need to send these people away.
Those are Bruce Wayne's guests.
You have a name to maintain.
I don't care about my name.
It's not just your name, sir.
It's your father's name.
And it's all that's left of him.
Don't destroy it.
Thank you.
How did the stock offering go?
Prices soared.
Who was buying?
All kinds of funds and brokerages.
It's a bit technical.
The key thing is...
Great.
A little the worse for wear, I'm afraid.
GORDON: What was the plan, Crane?
How were you gonna get your toxin into the air?
Scarecrow.
Scarecrow.
Who were you working for, Crane?
Oh, it's too late.
You can't stop it now.
GORDON: Here.
MAN: Happy birthday, Bruce.
And thank you for that item.
You're welcome.
How long would it take to manufacture on a large scale?
Weeks.
Why?
Somebody's planning to disperse the toxin using the water supply.
The water supply won't help you disperse an inhalant.
What?
Unless you have a microwave emitter powerful enough...
in the mains.
A microwave emitter like the one Wayne Enterprises just misplaced.
Misplaced?
Earle just fired me for asking too many questions about it.
Go back to Wayne Enterprises now and start making more of that antidote.
The police are gonna need as much as they can get their hands on.
My security clearance has been revoked.
That wouldn't stop a man like you, would it?
I suppose not.
Now, am I pronouncing this right...
You're not Ra's al Ghul.
I watched him die.
DUCARD: But is Ra's al Ghul immortal?
Are his methods supernatural?
Or cheap parlor tricks to conceal your true identity, Ra's?
Surely a man who spends his nights scrambling over the rooftops of Gotham...
I saved your life.
I warned you about compassion, Bruce.
Your quarrel is with me.
You let these people go.
You are welcome to explain the situation to them.
BRUCE: Everyone.
Everybody?
I....
I want to thank you all for coming here tonight and drinking all of my booze.
No, really.
There's a thing about being a Wayne...
a few freeloaders, like yourselves...
So here's to you people.
Thank you.
To all of you....
All of you phonies, all of you two-faced friends...
who smile through your teeth at me...
Please go.
Stop smiling, it's not a joke.
Please leave.
The party's over, get out.
The apple has fallen very far from the tree, Mr.
Wayne.
He's turning into a jerk.
Amusing.
But pointless.
None of these people have long to live.
Your antics at the asylum have forced my hand.
So Crane was working for you.
His toxin is derived from the organic compound found in our blue flowers.
He was able to weaponize it.
He's not a member of the League of Shadows?
Of course not.
He thought our plan was to hold the city to ransom.
But really, you are gonna release Crane's poison on the entire city.
Then watch Gotham tear itseIf apart through fear.
You're gonna destroy millions of lives.</i> DUCARD: Only a cynical man would call what these people have "lives," Wayne.
Crime.
Despair.
This is not how man was supposed to live.
The League of Shadows has been a check against human corruption...
We sacked Rome.
Loaded trade ships with plague rats.
Burned London to the ground.
Every time a civilization reaches the pinnacle of its decadence...
Gotham isn't beyond saving.
Give me more time.
There are good people here.
You're defending a city so corrupt...
every level of its infrastructure.
Time to play.
When I found you in that jail, you were lost.
But I believed in you.
I took away your fear, and I showed you a path.
You were my greatest student.
It should be you standing by my side, saving the world.
I'll be standing where I belong.
Between you and the people of Gotham.
No one can save Gotham.
When a forest grows too wild, a purging fire is inevitable and natural.
Tomorrow the world will watch in horror as its greatest city destroys itseIf.
The movement back to harmony will be unstoppable this time.
Over the ages our weapons have grown more sophisticated.
With Gotham we tried a new one.
Economics.
But we underestimated certain of Gotham's citizens...
Gunned down by one of the very people they were trying to help.
Create enough hunger and everyone becomes a criminal.
Their deaths galvanized the city into saving itseIf...
ever since.
We are back to finish the job.
And this time no misguided idealists will get in the way.
Like your father, you lack the courage to do all that is necessary.
If someone stands in the way of true justice...
and stab them in the heart.
Justice is balance.
You burned my house and left me for dead.
Consider us even.
No one comes out.
Make sure.
GORDON: They're all gone?
Serial killers, rapists.
Raise the bridges.
We don't want any getting off the island.
FLASS: Yeah, I'll raise the bridges...
to catch the homicidal maniacs...
I hope you're not a member of the fire brigade.
Master Wayne!
Master Wayne!
What is the point of all those pushups if you can't even lift a bloody log?
BRUCE: What have I done, AIfred?
Everything my family...
The Wayne legacy is more than bricks and mortar, sir.
I wanted to save Gotham.
I failed.
Why do we fall, sir?
So that we can learn to pick ourselves up.
You still haven't given up on me?
Never.
GORDON: Down!
MAN: Harassment!
I see harassment!
Maybe you'd like to see some excessive force?
Madman with a gun.
With residents furious...</i> strength to round up the inmates....</i> We're about to raise these bridges.
Officer, I am a Gotham City district attorney.
Let me pass.
OFFICER 1: Hold these people back.
OFFICER 2: Hey, Gordon.
Somebody here to see you.
It counteracts Crane's toxin.
Hopefully you won't need it.
Not unless he's got some way of getting that crap into the air.
All right, last one across.
OFFICER 1: People, they want this bridge up in no more than three minutes!
Better get you off the island before they raise the bridges.
Patrolman!
Go!
I can't find my mom.
RACHEL: Hey!
What the hell are you doing?
DUCARD: Gentlemen...
And the word is...
Jesus.
The pressure, it's spiking.
Right there.
MAN: That water main is right under the Narrows.
RACHEL: It's okay.
This is Commissioner Loeb.
Come on, somebody talk to me.
Come on!
GORDON: Loeb, Loeb.
This is Gordon.
What the hell is going on?
We need reinforcements.
TAC teams, SWAT, riot cops!
Gordon!
All the city's riot police are on the island with you!
Well, they're completely incapacitated!</i> It's okay, it's okay.
No one's gonna hurt you.
SCARECROW: Of course they are!
Gordon...
GORDON: So I'm on my own?
The Narrows is tearing itseIf to pieces.
This is just the beginning.
If they hit the whole city...
tearing itseIf apart.
the central hub beneath Wayne Tower.</i> that'll vaporize the city's water supply.
Covering Gotham in this poison.
I'm gonna stop him from loading that train, but I may need your help.
SCARECROW: There you are!
There is nothing to fear...
I am here to help you!
Batman will save us.
He'll come.
This is Gordon.
Prepare to lower the bridge.
I told you he'd come.
RACHEL: Wait.
You could die.
At least tell me your name.
It's not who I am underneath...
Bruce?
Well, well.
You took my advice about theatricality a bit literally.
My fight, however, lies with the rest of Gotham.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a city to destroy.
GPS online.</i> DUCARD: Gentlemen.
Who the hell authorized this?
Distance to Wayne Tower, three miles.</i> The pressure's moving along the mains, blowing the pipes.
If that pressure reaches us...
the whole city is gonna blow!
At the next intersection, turn right.</i> You will never learn.
Sorry.
You have arrived at Wayne Tower.</i> MAN: Evacuate the building.
We're on top of the main hub and it's gonna blow.
Weapons system activated.</i> Nice ride.
Armed.</i> Don't be afraid, Bruce.
Come on.
Come on.
DUCARD: You are just an ordinary man in a cape.
That's why you couldn't fight injustice, that's why you can't stop this train.
Who said anything about stopping it?
Yes!
BATMAN: You never learned to mind your surroundings!
Have you finally learned to do what is necessary?
I won't kill you...
JESSlCA: The meeting's already started.
Fox, I seem to remember firing you.
You did.
I got another job.
Yours.
On whose authority?
ALFRED: Batman may have made the front page...
got pushed to page eight.
Bruce Wayne.
What makes you think you can decide who's running Wayne Enterprises?
EARLE: What are you talking about?</i> The company went public a week ago.
And I bought most of the shares.
and trusts and so forth.</i> Look, it's all a bit technical, but the important thing...
is secure.</i> Right, Mr.
Fox?
FOX: Right you are, Mr.
Wayne.
Didn't you get the memo?
The day that Chill died, l....
I said terrible things.
But true things.
I was a coward with a gun...
than revenge, so thank you.
I never stopped thinking about you.
About us.
And when I heard you were back, l....
I started to hope.
But then I found out about your mask.
Batman's just a symbol, Rachel.
No.
This...
Your real face is the one that criminaIs now fear.
The man I loved...
But maybe he's still out there somewhere.
Maybe someday, when Gotham no longer needs Batman...
Your father would be very proud of you.
Just like me.
RACHEL: What will you do?
Rebuild it.
Just the way it was, brick for brick.
Just the way it was, sir?
Yeah, why?
I thought this might be a good opportunity for...
BATMAN: Well, sergeant?
You really started something.
Bent cops running scared.
Hope on the streets.
And we still haven't picked up Crane or haIf the inmates of Arkham that he freed.
We will.
We can bring Gotham back.
We start carrying semiautomatics, they buy automatics.
We start wearing Kevlar, they buy armor-piercing rounds.
Now, take this guy.
Armed robbery, double homicide.
Got a taste for the theatrical, like you.
Leaves a calling card.
I'll look into it.
I never said thank you.
And you'll never have to.
English!
I'm English!
It's grenadiers, mate.
Make way!
Out of the way!
Go, go, go!
Along the mole.
All the way.
The ship's about to leave.
Along the mole.
All the way.
The ship's about to leave.
Where's the bloody air force?
The navy's requisitioned her.
They'll be back in an hour.
My dad wants to be ready before then.
They've told us to strip her and load those life jackets.
Some men across the Channel, at Dunkirk, need taking off.
Some men?
Check fuel, Fortis 1 and 2.
Stay down at 500 feet to leave fuel for 40-minute fighting time over Dunkirk.
Understood.
Vector 128, angels point five.
And keep an eye on that gauge, even when it gets lively.
Save enough to get back.
No French soldiers.
No French soldiers.
No.
No, no French.
English only.
English only past this point.
No.
It's a British ship.
No, you have your own ships.
Get back.
Get back.
No, you've got your own ships.
This is a British ship.
No, get back.
Look, get the stretchers through.
There are stretchers coming.
Get out of the way!
Out of the way!
Go, go, go.
Along the mole.
All the way.
The ship's about to leave.
About to leave.
Along the mole.
All the way.
Along the mole.
Along the mole.
All the way.
All the way.
No.
No, English only.
English only!
No!
Ready on the stern!
Yes, sir!
Man the bowline!
Any more room?
You have to get back!
That's two minutes.
You've missed it.
You've missed it.
Is that the last one?
Aye, sir.
Break the line.
Come on!
Come on!
Dunkirk's so far.
Why can't they just load at Calais?
The enemy had something to say about it.
Ah, down here we're sitting ducks.
Keep 'em peeled.
They'll come out of the sun.
Up the line.
Oi.
We'll take it.
Drop the gangplank!
Yes, sir!
Take a run at it.
Ready on the stern line, George.
Aren't you waiting on the navy?
They've asked for the Moonstone, they'll have her.
And her captain.
And his son.
Thanks for the help, George.
What are you doing?
You do know where we're going?
France.
Into war, George.
I'll be useful, sir.
Bandit, 11 o'clock.
Break.
He's on me.
I'm on him.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight...
Oi, you two.
Get a shift on.
Yeah, pull him tight.
Tie a knot in it.
Back up the line.
Both of you.
Off you go.
Off you go!
That last barrage has damaged the rudder.
Uh, okay...
Psst!
Mr.
Dawson!
One of ours, George.
On my mark, Fortis 2.
Draw him left.
Three, two, one.
Mark.
Clear.
Is he down?
Yeah, he's down for the count.
Fortis Leader, one bandit down.
Fortis Leader, do you read?
Fortis 2, I have you to my port.
I have no eyes on Fortis Leader.
Over.
Understood, Fortis 1.
Orbit for a look.
How long, Lieutenant?
We need to run a new cable, sir.
They're scrambling.
Very well.
Colonel, you're gonna have to decide how many more wounded to evacuate.
One stretcher takes the space of seven standing men.
Excuse me.
How's the perimeter?
Shrinking every day.
But between our rear guard and the French, we're holding the line.
And the enemy tanks have stopped.
Why have they stopped?
Waste precious tanks when they can pick us off from the air, like fish in a barrel?
How long does London expect the army to hold out before we make terms?
Make terms?
They're not stopping here.
We need to get our army back.
Britain's next and then the rest of the world.
Christ.
I mean, you can practically see it from here.
What?
Home.
What about the French?
Publicly, Churchill's told them, Arm in arm, leaving together.
And privately?
We need our army back.
How many men are they talking about, sir?
Churchill wants 30,000.
Ramsay's hoping we can give him 45.
There are 400,000 men on this beach, sir.
We'll just have to do our best.
Right, well, this mole stays open at all costs.
We're in artillery range from the west.
If anything else sinks here, the mole's blocked and we're stuffed.
Can't we load from the beaches?
Better than standing out here when the dive bombs come.
over three feet can't get near.
We don't have enough small boats to ferry men to the destroyers.
The mole it is, then, gentlemen.
Hey!
Hey!
Can you swim it?
Dad, can you get closer?
Can't risk it!
Hang on.
What's your name?
Wreckage below.
Is it more of the 109?
No.
It's Fortis Leader.
Over.
You think he got out?
I didn't see a 'chute.
Record his position.
Then set heading 128, height 1,000.
Over.
Vector 128, angels one.
Understood.
Fortis 2, what's your fuel?
All right, keep letting me know.
My gauge took a bit of a knock back there.
Shouldn't you turn back?
No, no.
I'm fairly confident it's just the gauge.
What about the wounded?
Abandon ship!
Abandon ship!
Cut her loose, and push her off!
We can't let her sink at the mole!
Push the bloody boat off!
Help us!
Do you want to come below?
It's much warmer.
It's out of the wind.
Here you go.
Leave him be, George.
He feels safer on deck.
You would too if you'd been bombed.
U-boat.
It was a U-boat.
Get him some more tea, George.
Right, we're about five minutes out, so climb to 2,000.
Over.
That's more fuel.
I know, but I don't want to get jumped again.
Let's get a decent altitude.
We can dive down on the bastards from above.
Over.
Understood.
Angels two.
Over.
Right, Highlanders.
Let's find you another ship.
Come on.
Everyone else, keep climbing.
Climb on the deck.
Climb on the deck.
Watch your heads on the rail.
Watch it.
That's right, keep going down.
Take a blanket.
Down you go.
Put this on, my love.
Down you go.
Keep going down.
There's a nice cup of tea for you down there.
Keep moving down.
Take a blanket.
Try and make some room.
Keep moving down, boys.
This way.
A cup of tea down there.
There you go.
Down there.
Move down there.
What's wrong with your friend?
He's looking for a quick way out.
In case we go down.
Where are we going?
Dunkirk.
No, uh, no, no, we're going to England.
We have to go to Dunkirk first.
Look, I'm not going back.
I'm not going back.
Look at it.
If we go there, we'll die.
I see your point, son.
Well, let's plot a course.
You can take your tea below and warm up.
Peter, have we got space for a man to lie down?
Uh, yeah.
Here, come on.
Careful.
Careful.
Just in there.
I'll get you some more tea.
Is he a coward, Mr.
Dawson?
He's shell-shocked, George.
He's not himself.
He may never be himself again.
Here you are.
Heinkel, 11 o'clock.
She's lining up to drop her load on that minesweeper.
Fighters?
Yeah, 109s off her starboard.
I'm on the bomber.
Got him!
Got him!
Oh, she's turning.
You must've damaged her.
Where's the escort?
Well, I got one of...
Jesus!
I'm going down.
I'm on him.
Bail out.
No, the swell looks good.
I'm ditching.
Pick us up!
Pick us up!
Come back!
Torpedo!
Abandon ship!
Abandon ship!
Help!
Get us out of here!
Spitfires, George.
Greatest plane ever built.
You didn't even look.
Rolls-Royce Merlin engines.
Sweetest sound you could hear out here.
Hello?
Could you open the door?
Hello?
Can you hear me?
Open the door!
Do you hear me?
He wants to come out.
What have you done?
Locked him in?
Let him out, for God's sake.
Hello?
Let me out!
You haven't turned around.
No.
We have a job to do.
Job?
This is a pleasure yacht.
You're weekend sailors, not the bloody navy.
A man your age?
Men my age dictate this war.
Why should we be allowed to send our children to fight it?
You should be at home!
Well, there won't be any home if we allow a slaughter across the Channel.
He's turning tail.
I'm gonna get after him.
Good luck.
Watch your fuel.
You're at 15 gallons.
Best of luck, Collins.
Collins, do you read?
Oi!
No!
No!
Get off!
Get off!
Piss off, the both of you.
It's too crowded.
You can't leave us!
Make some room!
No!
No!
Get off!
You men, leave off.
You'll capsize the boat.
She's gone over twice on the way out here.
You have to stay calm.
There are plenty of boats.
Calm?
Wait till you get torpedoed, then tell us to be calm!
You have life jackets?
Yes, they do.
Don't panic, boys.
The water's not too rough or too cold.
We're heading back to the beach.
We can't make it across the Channel in this, lads.
We need to get back to the beach and wait for another ride.
You men in the water, float here, save your strength.
We'll come back for you.
Oars in!
Together, pull!
Together, pull!
Pull!
Together, pull!
Pull!
Together, pull!
There's no hiding from this, son.
What is it you think you can do out there, on this thing?
There's not just us.
A call went out.
We aren't the only ones to answer, you know.
You don't even have guns.
Do you have a gun?
Yes, of course.
A rifle, a 303.
Did it help you against the dive bombers and the U-boats?
You're an old fool.
I'm not going back.
I'm not going back.
Turn it around.
I'm not turning round.
Turn it around!
Turn it...
Wait, wait!
Calm it down, mate.
George?
George!
What have you done?
Okay, you're all right, George.
You're all right.
Hang on.
Okay.
Okay, just...
That's it.
That's good enough.
It's gonna keep some pressure on.
There we go.
There we go.
Can you hear me, George?
Come on, lads!
Come on!
Come on, boys!
It's a pier.
For when the water comes in.
The tide's turning now.
How can you tell?
The bodies come back.
Hey.
Hey, Highlanders!
Hey, Highlanders!
What's that way?
A boat.
She's grounded.
Not when the tide comes in, she's not.
Be a brave lad.
You and Mr.
Dawson?
It's the best thing I've ever done.
You're all right.
You're okay.
Sea Cadet.
It's the only thing I've ever done.
It's all right.
It's okay.
Just have some water.
I told my dad...
I've done nothing at school and that I would do something one day.
Maybe get in the local paper.
Maybe my teachers would see it.
Okay, get some rest.
I need you back up on deck as soon as you're able.
I can't.
What?
I can't see.
Sir.
The French have been forced back on the western side.
They're still holding a perimeter?
For now.
Officer coming through.
Move yourselves.
Move yourselves!
Where are the destroyers?
There'll be one soon.
One?
After yesterday's losses, it's one ship on the mole at a time.
The battle is here.
What the hell are they saving them for?
The next battle.
The one for Britain.
It's the same with the planes.
But it's right there.
You can practically...
Seeing home doesn't help us get there, Colonel.
They need to send more ships.
Every hour the enemy pushes closer.
They've activated the small vessels pool.
Small vessels?
It's the list of civilian boats for requisition.
Civilian?
We need destroyers.
Small boats can load from the beach.
Not in these conditions.
Well, I'd rather face waves than dive bombers.
No, you're right.
They won't get up in this.
The Royal Engineers are building piers from lorries.
At least that should help us when the tide comes back.
Well, we'll know in six hours' time.
I thought the tides were every three?
Then it's good that you're army and I'm navy, isn't it?
There.
Vanquisher.
Where's the crew?
Probably got spooked after they ran aground.
Scarpered up the beach.
Why?
Enemy could be right there.
All right, best shut ourselves inside, boys.
Wait for the high tide.
How long's that?
Every three hours.
I've put a bit of pressure on it.
Strapped him up, made him comfortable.
What?
It's bad, Dad.
Well, should we turn back?
We've come so far.
Dad, is that one of ours?
That's a Heinkel.
They'll go for that minesweeper there.
Hang on.
Shouldn't we stand by to pick up survivors?
To do that we have to survive ourselves.
Poke your head out.
See if the water's come in.
Talkative sod, aren't you?
It's barely come in at all.
What goes out comes back in again, right?
Yeah, but how long?
Spitfires!
Come on.
Come on, come on.
Dad, he got him!
Yeah!
Yeah!
The Heinkel's moving off.
Yeah.
Oh, no.
Smoke from the Spitfire!
Watch for a parachute!
Oi.
Oi.
Oi.
Are you German?
No, Dutch.
Dutch!
Merchant navy.
Here to pick you up.
To help you.
Why'd you leave your boat?
In case the Germans come.
We wait up the beach.
With the soldiers.
Wait for the tide.
You came back.
The tide must be in.
Coming.
Coming, yes.
But more hours till we float.
Hours?
Why'd you come back?
Not so heavy when I left.
No 'chute!
Best of luck, Collins.
Collins, do you read?
He's down.
Dad.
Dad, watch the engine.
Dad, he's down.
There was no 'chute.
Dad, come on.
There was no 'chute.
He's probably dead.
Damn it, I hear you, Peter!
I hear you!
He may be alive.
Maybe.
We may be able to help him.
No!
Then they'll know we're in here.
Why else are they shooting at us?
Look at the grouping.
Target practice.
Go.
Plug it.
Go, go.
We have to plug it.
After you, mate.
You ready?
Go!
How do we get off?
Do we need to ditch some ballast?
Weight!
Do we need to lose weight?
Weight.
Weight, yes.
Yes.
Somebody needs to get off.
Well volunteered.
We don't need a volunteer.
I know someone who ought to get off.
This one.
He's a German spy.
Don't be daft.
He's a fucking Jerry.
Have you noticed he hasn't said a word?
He don't speak English.
If he does it's with an accent that's thicker than sauerkraut sauce.
You're daft.
Tell him.
Yeah.
Tell me.
Tell me, Gibson.
Tell me!
Tell him, for God's sake!
A frog.
A bloody frog.
A cowardly little queue-jumping frog.
Who's Gibson, eh?
Some naked, dead Englishman lying out on that sand?
Did you at least have the decency to bury him?
He did.
I helped him.
I thought it was his mate.
How do we know?
How hard is it to find a dead Englishman on Dunkirk beach?
He didn't kill anyone.
He was just looking for a way off the sand, like the rest of us.
Haven't they had enough practice by now?
They're trying to make sure she won't float.
Will she still float?
Float, yes.
Yes, with less weight.
And we know who's getting off.
No, you can't do that.
He's French.
He's on our side.
Go on.
Up you go.
As soon as he pokes his head out, they'll slaughter him.
Better him than me.
It's not fair.
Survival's not fair.
No, it's shit.
It's fear, and it's greed.
Fate pushed through the bowels of men.
Shit.
He saved our lives.
And he's about to do it again.
No, don't!
Stop!
Somebody's gotta get off, so the rest of us can live.
If you wanna volunteer...
Fuck no.
I'm going home.
And if this is the price?
I'll live with it.
But it's wrong.
Go on!
One man's not going to make enough difference.
You'd best hope it does, because you'd be volunteering next.
What?
We're regimental brothers, mate.
It's just the way it is.
We float!
We float!
Start the bloody engine!
Afternoon.
I'm sorry, son.
I really don't know.
You're right not moving him.
You've done the best for him you can.
We've wasted the day.
I share your frustration, Colonel.
Johnny!
Grounded trawler, taking fire.
They're breaking through the dunes to the east.
This is it.
Plug the holes!
With what?
Plug the holes!
Other side!
Other side!
What do you see?
Home.
Is he all right?
The boy?
No.
No, he's not.
Dad!
Come on.
Come on, Farrier.
Come on.
There's men in the water!
Oil.
It's oil.
Oil.
You're getting into oil!
Keep coming.
Plenty of room.
All right, below deck.
Abandon ship!
Gibson!
Leave it!
Below decks.
Listen, we have to get as many of you on board as we can before that oil catches fire.
You go below decks or you get off my boat.
That's your choice.
Keep coming.
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Careful!
Careful down there!
Careful!
Careful down there!
He's dead, mate.
So be bloody careful with him.
Um, will he be okay?
The boy?
Yeah.
He's coming back round.
He's coming back round!
Come on, Farrier.
Come on.
Get off the ship!
Come on, Farrier.
Get around them.
Come on, come on.
Go.
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Easy.
Take me home.
Where are you from?
Out of Dartmouth!
Christ.
You from Deal?
I am!
You watch the current at the mouth!
Aye.
And thank you!
That's a fighter.
Yes, an Me 109.
From the south.
Peter, you take the tiller.
Listen for my instructions.
Point her south!
Full speed, Peter.
Keep coming round.
Keep coming.
Before he fires, he's gotta drop his nose.
I'll give you the signal.
Wait for him to commit to his line.
Now!
He's gone.
Yeah, bigger fish to fry.
How'd you know that stuff, anyway?
My son's one of you lot.
I knew he'd see us through.
You're RAF?
No.
Not me.
My brother.
He flew Hurricanes.
Died third week into the war.
No, stay downstairs, please.
We just wanna see the cliffs.
That's Dorset.
But it's home.
We let you all down, didn't we?
Christ, how many you got in there?
Make your way to the trains.
Where the hell were you?
They know where you were.
Bye.
Cup of tea?
Cup of tea?
Well done.
Well done.
Well done, lads.
Well done.
Well done, lads.
Well done.
All we did is survive.
That's enough.
Well done.
Well done.
That old bloke wouldn't even look us in the eye.
Come on, private!
I know we're officers, but it's us or the enemy.
So now is not the time to be particular.
Well, Churchill got his 30,000.
And then some.
Almost 300,000.
So far.
So far?
I'm staying.
For the French.
Hey!
Where are we?
Siding.
You'll be pulling in in a minute.
What station?
Woking.
Grab me one of them papers.
Go on!
Can't bear it.
You read it.
Can't bear it?
They'll be spitting at us in the streets.

I can't look.

I know what this is.
I've seen one before.
Many.
many years ago.
It beIonged to a man I met in a haIf-remembered dream.
A man possessed of some radicaI notions.
COBB: What is the most resiIient parasite?
A bacteria?
A virus?
An intestinaI worm?
ARTHUR: Uh....
What Mr.
Cobb is trying to say-- An idea.
ResiIient.
HighIy contagious.
Once an idea has taken hoId of the brain.
it's aImost impossibIe to eradicate.
An idea that is fuIIy formed.
fuIIy understood.
that sticks.
Right in there somewhere.
For someone Iike you to steaI?
Yes.
In the dream state.
your conscious defenses are Iowered...
vuInerabIe to theft.
It's caIIed extraction.
Mr.
Daito.
we can train your subconscious to defend itseIf...
How can you do that?
Because I am the most skiIIed extractor.
I know how to search your mind and find your secrets.
I know the tricks.
And I can teach them to you.
so that even when you're asIeep...
Look.
if you want my heIp.
you're gonna have to be compIeteIy open with me.
I need to know my way around your thoughts better than your wife...
better than anyone.
If this is a dream.
and you have a safe fuII of secrets...
In order for this aII to work.
you need to compIeteIy Iet me in.
Enjoy your evening.
gentIemen.
as I consider your proposaI.
He knows.
What's going on up there?
Daito knows.
He's pIaying with us.
Doesn't matter.
I can get it here.
Trust me.
The information is in the safe.
He Iooked right at it when I mentioned secrets.
What's she doing here?
Just head back to the room.
AII right?
I'II take care of this.
Okay.
make sure you do.
We're here to work.
If I jumped.
wouId I survive?
With a cIean dive.
perhaps.
MaI.
what are you doing here?
I thought you might be missing me.
COBB: You know that I am.
But I can't trust you anymore.
Do what?
MAL: Looks Iike Arthur's taste.
ActuaIIy.
the subject is partiaI to postwar British painters.
PIease.
have a seat.
MAL: TeII me...
You can't imagine.
What are you doing?
Just getting some fresh air.
Dtay where you are.
MaI.
Goddamn it.
THEN GUARD GRUNTD] DAITO: Turn around.
The gun.
Dom.
PIease.
Now the enveIope.
Mr.
Cobb.
Did she teII you?
Or have you known aII aIong?
That you're here to steaI from me.
or that we are actuaIIy asIeep?
I want to know the name of your empIoyer.
Ah.
there's no use threatening him in a dream.
right.
MaI?
That depends on what you're threatening.
KiIIing him wouId just wake him up.
But pain....
Pain is in the mind.
And judging by the decor.
we're in your mind.
aren't we.
Arthur?
I'm gonna try to keep Daito under a IittIe bit Ionger.
We're aImost there.
He was cIose.
Very cIose.
Dtop him!
This isn't gonna work.
Wake him up.
He won't wake.
NADH: What?
Dunk him.
COBB: He's out.
You came prepared.
hmm?
Not even my head of security knows this apartment.
How did you find it?
It's difficuIt for a man of your position to keep a Iove nest Iike this secret...
a married woman invoIved.
COBB: WeII.
that's not true.
You Ieft out a key piece of information.
didn't you?
You heId something back because you knew what we were up to.
We extracted every bit of information you had in there.
But your deception was obvious.
That corporation that hired us.
they won't accept faiIure.
We won't Iast two days.
Cobb?
Looks Iike I'm gonna have to do this a IittIe more simpIy.
TeII us what you know!
TeII us what you know.
now!
DAITO: I've aIways hated this carpet.
It's stained and frayed in such distinctive ways.
But very definiteIy made of wooI.
Right now...
Which means I'm not Iying on my carpet.
in my apartment.
You have Iived up to your reputation.
Mr.
Cobb.
I'm stiII dreaming.
Dream within a dream.
huh?
I'm impressed.
But in my dream.
you pIay by my ruIes.
Ah.
yes.
but you see.
Mr.
Daito....
We're not in your dream.
We're in mine.
AsshoIe.
How do you mess up the carpet?
I didn't know he was gonna rub his cheek on it!
That's enough.
You.
What the heII was aII that?
We don't have time for this.
I'm getting off at Kyoto.
ARTHUR: He's not gonna check every compartment.
Yeah.
weII.
I don't Iike trains.
Listen.
Every man for himseIf.
Yes.
heIIo?
PHILLIPA: <i>Hi, Daddy.</i> JAMED: <i>Hi, Dad.</i> Hey.
guys.
Hey.
How are you?
How you doing.
huh?
PHILLIPA: <i>Good.</i> JAMED: <i>Okay, l guess.</i> Okay?
Who's just okay?
Is that you.
James?
JAMED: WeII.
I can't.
sweetheart.
I can't.
Not for a whiIe.
remember?
JAMED: Look.
I toId you.
I'm away because I'm working.
right?
PHILLIPA: COBB: Put Grandma on the phone for me.
wiII you?
PHILLIPA: WeII.
just hope she's wrong about that.
JAMED: Yeah.
James?
JAMED: James.
we taIked about this.
Mommy's not here anymore.
JAMED: WOMAN: Listen.
I'm gonna send some presents with Grandpa.
aII right?
And you be good.
you be-- Hey.
are you okay?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm fine.
Why?
WeII.
down in the dream.
MaI showing up.
Look.
I'm.
uh.
sorry about your Ieg.
Won't happen again.
We were supposed to deIiver Daito's expansion pIans...
By now.
they know we faiIed.
It's time we disappear.
I can Iie Iow there.
maybe sniff out a job when things quiet down.
You?
Dtateside.
Dend my regards.
He soId you out.
Thought to come to me and bargain for his Iife.
Do I offer you the satisfaction.
It's not the way I deaI with things.
But I can't speak for CoboI Engineering.
If you can steaI an idea from someone's mind...
Okay.
here's me pIanting an idea in your head.
I say.
''Don't think about eIephants.'' What are you thinking about?
EIephants.
Right.
But it's not your idea.
because you know I gave it to you.
The subject's mind can aIways trace the genesis of the idea.
Because I can find my own way to square things with CoboI.
Then you do have a choice.
Then I choose to Ieave.
sir.
TeII the crew where you want to go.
Hey.
Mr.
Cobb.
How wouId you Iike to go home?
To America.
To your chiIdren.
You can't fix that.
No one can.
No idea is simpIe when you need to pIant it in somebody eIse's mind.
My main competitor is an oId man in poor heaIth.
His son wiII soon inherit controI of the corporation.
I need him to decide to break up his father's empire.
If I were to do this.
if I even couId do it...
But I can.
Do do you want to take a Ieap of faith...
fiIIed with regret...
AssembIe your team.
Mr.
Cobb.
And choose your peopIe more wiseIy.
Look.
I know how much you wanna go home.
This can't be done.
Yes.
it can.
Just have to go deep enough.
You don't know that.
I've done it before.
Who'd you do it to?
Why are we going to Paris?
We're gonna need a new architect.
COBB: You never did Iike your office.
did you?
No space to think in that broom cupboard.
Is it safe for you to be here?
Extradition between France and the United Dtates...
you know that.
I think they might find a way to make it work in your case.
Look.
I.
uh.
brought these for you to give to the kids when you have a chance.
It'II take more than the occasionaI stuffed animaI...
they stiII have a father.
I'm just doing what I know.
I'm doing what you taught me.
I never taught you to be a thief.
No.
you taught me to navigate peopIe's minds.
But after what happened...
ways for me to use that skiII.
What are you doing here.
Dom?
I think I found a way home.
It's a job for some very.
very powerfuI peopIe.
PeopIe who I beIieve can fix my charges permanentIy.
But I need your heIp.
You're here to corrupt one of my brightest and best.
You know what I'm offering.
Let them decide for themseIves.
You remember.
It's the chance to buiId cathedraIs.
entire cities...
in the reaI worId.
Do you want me to Iet someone eIse foIIow you into your fantasy?
They don't actuaIIy come into the dream.
They just design the IeveIs and teach them to the dreamers.
That's aII.
Design it yourseIf.
MaI won't Iet me.
Come back to reaIity.
Dom.
Those kids.
your grandchiIdren...
back home.
That's their reaIity.
And this job.
this Iast job.
that's how I get there.
I wouId not be standing here if I knew any other way.
I need an architect who's as good as I was.
I've got somebody better.
I'd Iike you to meet Mr.
Cobb.
PIeased to meet you.
If you have a few moments.
Mr.
Cobb has a job offer he'd Iike to discuss with you.
A work pIacement?
Not exactIy.
I have a test for you.
You're not gonna teII me anything first?
Before I describe the job.
I have to know you can do it.
You have two minutes to design a maze that it takes one minute to soIve.
Dtop.
Again.
Dtop.
You're gonna have to do better than that.
That's more Iike it.
COBB: <i>They say we only use a fraction</i> When we're asIeep.
our mind can do aImost anything.
Duch as?
Imagine you're designing a buiIding.
You consciousIy create each aspect.
But sometimes.
it feeIs Iike it's aImost creating itseIf.
if you know what I mean.
Yeah.
Iike I'm discovering it.
Genuine inspiration.
right?
Now.
in a dream.
our mind continuousIy does this.
We create and perceive our worId simuItaneousIy.
And our mind does this so weII that we don't even know it's happening.
That aIIows us to get right in the middIe of that process.
Now.
this is where I need you.
You create the worId of the dream.
We bring the subject into that dream.
and they fiII it with their subconscious.
How couId I ever acquire enough detaiI to make them think that it's reaIity?
WeII.
dreams.
they feeI reaI whiIe we're in them.
right?
It's onIy when we wake up that we reaIize something was actuaIIy strange.
Let me ask you a question.
You never reaIIy remember the beginning of a dream.
do you?
You aIways wind up right in the middIe of what's going on.
I guess.
yeah.
Do how did we end up here?
WeII.
we just came from the.
uh....
Think about it.
Ariadne.
How did you get here?
Where are you right now?
We're dreaming?
You're in the middIe of the workshop.
sIeeping.
This is your first Iesson in shared dreaming.
Dtay caIm.
If it's just a dream.
then why are you--?
COBB: Because it's never just a dream.
is it?
And a face fuII of gIass hurts Iike heII.
When you're in it.
it feeIs reaI.
ARTHUR: That's why the miIitary deveIoped dream sharing.
It was a training program for soIdiers to shoot.
stab and strangIe each other...
ARIADNE: How did architects become invoIved?
COBB: WeII.
someone had to design the dreams.
right?
Why don't you give us another five minutes?
Five minutes?
What--?
We were taIking for.
Iike.
at Ieast an hour.
In a dream.
your mind functions more quickIy...
to feeI more sIow.
Five minutes in the reaI worId gives you an hour in the dream.
Why don't you see what you can get up to in five minutes?
COBB: You've got the basic Iayout.
Bookstore.
cafe.
AImost everything eIse is here too.
ARIADNE: Who are the peopIe?
Remember.
you are the dreamer.
You buiId this worId.
I am the subject.
My mind popuIates it.
You can IiteraIIy taIk to my subconscious.
That's one of the ways we extract information from the subject.
How eIse do you do it?
By creating something secure.
Iike a bank vauIt or a jaiI.
The mind automaticaIIy fiIIs it with information it's trying to protect.
WeII....
I guess I thought that the dream space wouId be aII about the visuaI...
My question is what happens when you start messing with the physics of it aII?
It's something.
isn't it?
Yes.
it is.
ARIADNE: Why are they aII Iooking at me?
Because my subconscious feeIs that someone eIse is creating this worId.
The more you change things.
the quicker the projections start to converge on you.
Converge?
They sense the foreign nature of the dreamer.
They attack.
Iike white bIood ceIIs fighting an infection.
Just you.
This is great.
but I'm teIIing you.
if you keep changing things Iike this....
Jeez.
mind teIIing your subconscious to take it easy?
It's my subconscious.
Remember?
I can't controI it.
Very impressive.
I know this bridge.
This pIace is reaI.
isn't it?
Yeah.
I cross it every day to get to the coIIege.
Never re-create pIaces from your memory.
AIways imagine new pIaces.
You draw from stuff you know.
right?
OnIy use detaiIs.
A streetIamp or a phone booth.
Never entire areas.
on what's reaI and what is a dream.
This has nothing to do with me.
understand?
That why you need me to buiId your dreams?
Hey.
get off of her.
Back up.
Back up.
Hey.
hey.
hey.
Look at me.
You're okay.
You're okay.
There was stiII time on the cIock.
You can't wake up from within the dream unIess you die.
ARIADNE: What?
A totem.
it's a smaII personaI-- That's some subconscious you've got on you.
Cobb!
Yeah.
Do a totem.
You need a smaII object.
potentiaIIy heavy.
Domething you can have on you that no one eIse knows.
ARIADNE: Like a coin?
ARTHUR: No.
It needs to be more unique than that.
Like.
this is a Ioaded die.
No.
I can't Iet you touch it.
That wouId defeat the purpose.
Dee.
onIy I know the baIance and the weight of this particuIar Ioaded die.
That way.
when you Iook at your totem...
you're not in someone eIse's dream.
I don't know if you can't see what's going on.
or if you just don't want to...
that he's tried to bury down there.
And I'm not about to just open my mind to someone Iike that.
Dhe'II be back.
I've never seen anyone pick it up that quickIy before.
ReaIity's not gonna be enough for her now.
and when she comes back....
When she comes back.
you're gonna have her buiIding mazes.
Eames?
No.
he's in Mombasa.
It's CoboI's back yard.
It's a necessary risk.
We need a forger.
Rub them together aII you want.
they're not gonna breed.
You never know.
COBB: I'm gonna get you a drink.
You're buying.
How's your handwriting?
Thank you very much.
Inception.
Now.
before you bother teIIing me it's impossibIe.
Iet me-- No.
it's perfectIy possibIe.
It's just bIoody difficuIt.
Interesting.
Because Arthur keeps teIIing me it can't be done.
Hmm.
Arthur.
You stiII working with that stick in the mud?
He is good at what he does.
right?
Oh.
he's the best.
but he has no imagination.
Not Iike you.
Listen.
if you're gonna perform inception.
you need imagination.
Let me ask you something.
Have you done it before?
We tried it.
Uh.
we got the idea in pIace.
but it didn't take.
You need the simpIest version of the idea...
in your subject's mind.
It's a subtIe art.
Do.
what is this idea that you need to pIant?
We need the heir of a major corporation to dissoIve his father's empire.
Right there you have various poIiticaI motivations...
and so forth.
But aII of that stuff.
it's.
um....
It's reaIIy at the mercy of your subject's prejudice.
you see?
What you have to do is start at the absoIute basic.
Which is what?
The reIationship with the father.
Right.
Okay.
weII.
there's a man here.
Yusuf.
He.
uh.
formuIates his own versions of the compounds.
Why don't you take me there?
Once you've Iost your taiI.
The man at the bar.
COBB: CoboI Engineering.
That price on my head.
was that dead or aIive?
Don't remember.
Let's see if he starts shooting.
Run interference.
I'II meet you downstairs in the bar in.
say.
uh.
haIf an hour?
AII right.
Freddy.
Freddy Dimmonds.
My God.
it's you.
isn't it?
No.
it isn't you.
Not dreaming now.
are you?
MAN: Get him!
There!
IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] One <i>cafe</i>.
Dhh.
One <i>cafe</i>.
One <i>cafe</i>.
Care for a Iift.
Mr.
Cobb?
Ah.
Do this is your idea of Iosing a taiI.
huh?
Different taiI.
Cobb said you'd be back.
It's just...
DhaII we take a Iook at some paradoxicaI architecture?
ARTHUR: You're gonna have to master a few tricks...
dream IeveIs.
Excuse me.
ARIADNE: What kind of tricks?
In a dream.
you can cheat architecture into impossibIe shapes.
That Iets you create cIosed Ioops.
Iike the Penrose Dteps.
The infinite staircase.
Dee?
Paradox.
Do a cIosed Ioop Iike that...
of the dream you create.
But how big do these IeveIs have to be?
It couId be anything from the fIoor of a buiIding to an entire city.
They have to be compIicated enough that we can hide from the projections.
And the better the maze....
Then the Ionger we have before the projections catch us?
ExactIy.
No one Iikes to feeI someone eIse messing around in their mind.
Cobb can't buiId anymore.
can he?
I don't know if he can't.
but he won't.
He thinks it's safer if he doesn't know the Iayouts.
Why?
He won't teII me.
But I think it's MaI.
No.
she's dead.
What you see in there is just his projection of her.
What was she Iike in reaI Iife?
Dhe was IoveIy.
YUDUF: <i>You are seeking a chemist?</i> COBB: <i>Yes.</i> To formuIate compounds for a job?
And to go into the fieId with us.
No.
I rareIy go into the fieId.
Mr.
Cobb.
WeII.
we'd need you there to taiIor compounds specific to our needs.
A dream within a dream?
Two IeveIs?
Three.
Not possibIe.
That many dreams within dreams is too unstabIe.
It is possibIe.
You just have to add a sedative.
A powerfuI sedative.
DAITO: Dix.
The onIy way to know you've done the job is if I go in with you.
There's no room for tourists on a job Iike this.
Mr.
Daito.
This time.
it seems there is.
This.
I think.
is a good pIace to start.
I use it every day.
COBB: What for?
Perhaps you wiII not want to see.
After you.
EAMED: Ten.
TweIve.
AII connected.
BIoody heII.
They come every day to share the dream.
You see?
Very stabIe.
YUDUF: Three.
four hours.
each day.
In dream time?
With this compound?
About 40 hours.
each and every day.
YUDUF: TeII him.
Mr.
Cobb.
After a whiIe.
it becomes the onIy way you can dream.
Do you stiII dream.
Mr.
Cobb?
MAN: No.
They come to be woken up.
The dream has become their reaIity.
Who are you to say otherwise.
sir?
Let's see what you can do.
You know how to find me.
You know what you have to do.
Dharp.
no?
DAITO: Are you aII right.
Mr.
Cobb?
Yeah.
yeah.
Everything's just fine.
Robert Fischer.
heir to the Fischer Morrow energy congIomerate.
COBB: What's your probIem with this Mr.
Fischer?
That's not your concern.
Mr.
Daito.
this isn't your typicaI corporate espionage.
You asked me for inception.
I do hope you understand the gravity of that request.
Now.
the seed that we pIant in this man's mind wiII grow into an idea.
This idea wiII define him.
It may come to change....
WeII.
it may come to change everything about him.
We're the Iast company standing between them and totaI energy dominance.
And we can no Ionger compete.
Doon.
they'II controI the energy suppIy of haIf the worId.
In effect.
they become a new superpower.
The worId needs Robert Fischer to change his mind.
EAMED: That's where we come in.
How is Robert Fischer's reIationship with his father?
Rumor is the reIationship is quite compIicated.
WeII.
we can't work based soIeIy on rumor.
can we?
Can you get me access to this man here?
Browning.
Fischer Denior's right-hand man.
Fischer Junior's godfather.
It shouId be possibIe.
if you can get the right references.
References are something of a speciaIty for me.
Mr.
Daito.
BROWNING: I'm not smeIIing settIement here.
Take them down.
LAWYER: Mr.
Browning...
is aIways one of avoiding Iitigation.
WeII.
shaII we voice your concerns with Maurice directIy?
Not sure that's necessary.
No.
no.
no.
I think we shouId.
BROWNING: How is he?
I don't want to bother him unnecessariIy.
but-- MAURICE: Robert.
I toId you keep out the damn-- Wait.
Do do it.
Get-- NURDE: Mr.
Fischer.
MAURICE: Put it through.
Never.
never.
Never do the same as I asked.
Leave that.
Here.
BROWNING: Must be a cherished memory of his.
I put it beside his bed.
He hasn't even noticed.
Robert...
a power of attorney.
EAMED: I've had ampIe opportunity to observe Browning...
Do now in the first Iayer of the dream.
I can impersonate Browning.
Then.
when we take him a IeveI deeper...
shouId feed that right back to him.
Do he gives himseIf the idea.
PreciseIy.
That's the onIy way it wiII stick.
It has to seem seIf-generated.
Eames.
I am impressed.
Your condescension.
as aIways.
is much appreciated.
Arthur.
thank you.
Were you going under on your own?
No.
no.
I was just.
uh.
running some experiments.
I didn't reaIize anyone was here.
so....
Yeah.
I was just-- I was working on my totem.
actuaIIy.
Here.
Iet me take a Iook.
Do you're Iearning.
huh?
An eIegant soIution for keeping track of reaIity.
It was MaI's.
actuaIIy.
This....
This one was hers.
Dhe wouId spin it in the dream and it wouId never toppIe.
Just spin and spin.
Arthur toId me she passed away.
How are the mazes coming aIong?
Each IeveI reIates to the part of the subject's subconscious...
Do I'm making the bottom IeveI a hospitaI.
so Fischer wiII bring his father.
You know.
I-- ActuaIIy.
I have a question about this Iayout.
No.
no.
no.
Don't show me specifics.
OnIy the dreamer shouId know the Iayout.
Why is that so important?
In case one of us brings in our projections.
We don't want them knowing the detaiIs of the maze.
You mean in case you bring MaI in.
You can't keep her out.
can you?
then she knows it.
WeII.
she'd sabotage the whoIe operation.
You've gotta warn them if this is getting worse.
No one said it's getting worse.
I need to get home.
That's aII I care about right now.
Why can't you go home?
Because they think I kiIIed her.
For not asking whether I did.
Now.
this is obviousIy an idea that Robert himseIf wouId choose to reject...
in his subconscious.
The subconscious is motivated by emotion.
right?
Not reason.
We need to find a way to transIate this into an emotionaI concept.
How do you transIate business strategy into emotion?
That's what we're here to figure out.
Robert's reIationship with his father...
We suggest breaking up his father's company as a ''screw you'' to the oId man.
No.
because I think positive emotion trumps negative emotion every time.
We aII yearn for reconciIiation.
for catharsis.
We need Robert Fischer to have a positive emotionaI reaction to aII this.
AII right.
weII.
try this.
Um....
for myseIf.
not foIIow in his footsteps.'' That might work.
Might?
We're gonna need to do a IittIe better than ''might.'' Thank you for your contribution.
Arthur.
Forgive me for wanting a IittIe specificity.
Eames.
Dpecificity?
Inception's not about being specific.
When we get inside his mind.
we're gonna have to work with what we find.
EAMED: On the top IeveI.
we open up his reIationship with his father...
in my father's footsteps.'' Then the next IeveI down.
we feed him.
Then.
by the time we hit the bottom IeveI.
we bring out the big guns.
EAMED: ExactIy.
Three Iayers down.
the dreams are gonna coIIapse with the sIightest disturbance.
Dedation.
For sIeep stabIe enough to create three Iayers of dreaming...
an extremeIy powerfuI sedative.
Good night.
YUDUF: <i>The compound we'll be using</i> Brain function in the dream wiII be about 20 times normaI.
And when you enter a dream within that dream.
the effect is compounded.
It's three dreams.
that's 10 hours times 20-- Math was never my strong subject.
How much time is that?
It's a week.
the first IeveI down.
Dix months the second IeveI down.
and the third IeveI-- That's 10 years.
Who'd wanna be stuck in a dream for 10 years?
Depends on the dream.
Do once we've made the pIant.
how do we get out?
I'm hoping you have something more eIegant than shooting me in the head.
EAMED: This.
Ariadne.
wouId be a kick.
It's that feeIing of faIIing you get that joIts you awake.
YUDUF: That's the cIever part.
I customized the sedative to Ieave inner-ear function unimpaired.
That way.
however deep the sIeep.
the sIeeper stiII feeIs faIIing.
The trick is to synchronize a kick that can penetrate aII three IeveIs.
We couId use a musicaI countdown to synchronize the different kicks.
EAMED: <i>He hasn't got any surgery</i> COBB: <i>Wasn't he supposed to have</i> Nothing.
Nothing that they'II put him under for.
anyway.
And we need-- We need at Ieast a good 10 hours.
Dydney to Los AngeIes.
One of the Iongest fIights in the worId.
He makes it every two weeks.
He must be fIying private.
then.
DAITO: Not if there were unexpected maintenance with his pIane.
ARTHUR: It wouId have to be a 7 47.
On a 7 47.
the piIot's up top...
so no one wouId waIk through.
You'd have to buy out the entire cabin and the first-cIass fIight attendant.
I bought the airIine.
It seemed neater.
WeII.
Iooks Iike we have our 10 hours.
Ariadne?
Terrific work.
by the way.
MAL: You know how to find me.
You know what you have to do.
You remember when you asked me to marry you?
Of course I do.
You said you had a dream.
That we'd grow oId together.
And we can.
COBB: You shouIdn't be here.
Just wanted to see what kind of tests you're doing on your own every night.
ARIADNE: Why do you do this to yourseIf?
It's the onIy way I can stiII dream.
Why is it so important to dream?
In my dreams.
we're stiII together.
These aren't just dreams.
These are memories.
And you said never to use memories.
I know I did.
You're trying to keep her aIive.
You can't Iet her go.
You don't understand.
These are moments I regret.
They're memories that I have to change.
WeII.
what's down there that you regret?
Listen.
there's onIy one thing you need to understand about me.
ARIADNE: This is your house?
Mine and MaI's.
yes.
Where is she?
Dhe's aIready gone.
That's my son.
James.
He's digging for something.
maybe a worm.
That's PhiIIipa.
I thought about caIIing out to them...
and I couId see...
but it's aII too Iate.
MAN: Right now or never.
Cobb.
COBB: Then I start to panic.
I reaIize I'm gonna regret this moment...
one Iast time.
WOMAN: James!
PhiIIipa!
Come on in!
COBB: But the moment's past.
And whatever I do.
I can't change this moment.
As I'm about to caII out to them...
If I'm ever gonna see their faces again.
I've gotta get back home.
The reaI worId.
What are you doing here?
My name is-- I know who you are.
What are you doing here?
I'm just trying to understand.
How couId you understand?
Do you know what it is to be a Iover?
To be haIf of a whoIe?
No.
I'II teII you a riddIe.
You're waiting for a train.
A train that wiII take you far away.
You know where you hope this train wiII take you...
But it doesn't matter.
How can it not matter to you where that train wiII take you?
COBB: Because you'II be together.
MAL: How couId you bring her here.
Dom?
This is a hoteI suite where we used to spend our anniversary.
What happened here?
You promised!
You promised we'd be together!
PIease.
I need you to stay here just for now!
You said we'd be together!
You said we'd grow oId together!
I'II come back for you.
I promise.
Do you think you can just buiId a prison of memories to Iock her in?
Do you reaIIy think that that's gonna contain her?
DAITO: It's time.
Maurice Fischer just died in Dydney.
Robert shouId accompany the body no Iater than Tuesday.
We shouId move.
AII right.
The team needs someone who understands what you're struggIing with.
And it doesn't have to be me...
what I just saw.
Get us another seat on the pIane.
COBB: If I get on this pIane and you don't honor our agreement...
I go to jaiI for the rest of my Iife.
CompIete the job en route...
getting through Immigration.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
I think this is yours?
You must have dropped it.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: WouId you care for a drink?
Oh.
Water.
pIease.
Oh.
um.
same.
pIease.
Um....
Thank you.
You know.
I couIdn't heIp but notice...
to the Maurice Fischer.
wouId you?
Yes.
he.
um....
He was my father.
WeII.
he was a very inspiring figure.
I'm sorry for your Ioss.
COBB: Hey.
To your father.
May he rest in peace.
huh?
Bit too much free champagne before takeoff?
Ha.
ha.
bIoody ha.
We know he's gonna be Iooking for a taxi in this weather.
ON RADIO] Just have him ca-- I gotta go.
AII right.
Taxi.
Thank you.
AII right.
Third and Market.
Dnappy.
Maybe not.
Can you puII over and get this--?
Great.
Come on.
There's $500 in there.
The waIIet's worth more than that.
You might at Ieast drop me at my stop.
I'm afraid that it doesn't-- EAMED: Down!
Down now!
What the heII is going on?
ARIADNE: This wasn't in the design.
Cobb?
Cobb?
Get him!
Are you aII right?
Yeah.
I'm okay.
I'm okay.
Fischer's okay.
unIess he gets carsick.
Daito?
COBB: Get Fischer in the back room now.
ARTHUR: What the heII happened?
COBB: Has he been shot?
Is he dying?
ARTHUR: I don't know.
ARTHUR: What happened to you?
Why put a train in a downtown intersection?
ARTHUR: Where'd it come from?
Why the heII were we ambushed?
Those were not normaI projections.
They'd been trained.
for God's sakes.
so his subconscious is miIitarized.
It shouId've shown in the research.
COBB: Why the heII didn't it?
COBB: Don't teII me to caIm down!
This was your job.
goddamn it!
This was your responsibiIity!
You were meant to check Fischer's background!
We'II be more carefuI and we're gonna be fine!
This was not a part of the pIan!
He's dying.
Put him out his misery.
He's in agony.
I'm waking him up.
No.
It won't wake him up.
What do you mean.
it won't wake him up?
When we die in a dream.
we wake up.
Not from this.
We're too heaviIy sedated to wake up that way.
Right.
Do.
what happens when we die?
ARTHUR: Unconstructed dream space.
ARIADNE: WeII.
what the heII is down there?
Nothing is down there.
except for what might have been Ieft behind...
who's been trapped there before.
Which.
in our case.
is just you.
YUDUF: Can't even think about...
Decades.
It couId be infinite.
Ask him.
he's the one who's been there.
ARTHUR: Let's get him upstairs.
Great.
Thank you.
Do now we're trapped in Fischer's mind.
battIing his own private army.
And if we get kiIIed...
turn to scrambIed egg.
hmm?
ARTHUR: Domeone got first aid?
This was the onIy way to go three Iayers deep.
You knew about this and went aIong with it?
I trusted him.
When?
When he promised you haIf his share?
No.
His whoIe share.
Besides.
he said he'd done it before.
What.
with MaI?
Because that worked so good?
That has nothing to do with it.
I did what I had to to get to my chiIdren.
You Ied us into a war zone with no way out?
There is a way out.
We continue on with the job.
and we do it as fast as possibIe...
just Iike before.
Forget it.
We go any deeper.
we just raise the stakes.
I am sitting this one out on this IeveI.
COBB: Fischer's security is surrounding this pIace.
Ten hours of fIight time is a week at this IeveI.
That means each and every one of us wiII be kiIIed.
That I can guarantee you.
We have no other choice but to continue on and do it as fast as possibIe.
Downwards is the onIy way forwards.
Get ready.
You.
come on.
Let's go shake him up.
I'm insured against kidnapping for up to 10 miIIion.
COBB: Dhut up!
It won't be.
ARTHUR: In your father's office.
beIow the booksheIves...
We need the combination.
I don't know any safe.
COBB: That doesn't mean you don't know the combination.
TeII us what it is.
I don't know.
We have it on good authority you do know.
Yeah?
Whose authority?
EAMED: What's inside it?
Cash.
cards.
ID.
And this.
UsefuI?
Maybe.
You're on.
You've got an hour.
An hour?
I was supposed to have aII night to crack this.
And Daito wasn't supposed to be shot in the chest.
You've got one hour.
now get us something usefuI.
pIease.
UncIe Peter.
Just make them stop.
Just Iet me taIk to him and I'II find out.
You have one hour.
Dtart taIking.
FIDCHER: You aII right?
You okay?
Those bastards have had at me for two days.
They have someone with access to your father's office.
They thought I'd know the combination.
but I don't know it.
Maurice toId me that when he passed.
you were the onIy one abIe to open it.
No.
he never gave me any combination.
Maybe he did.
I mean.
maybe you just didn't know it was a combination.
WeII.
what.
then?
I don't know.
some meaningfuI combination of numbers...
with Maurice.
We didn't have very many.
uh.
meaningfuI experiences together.
Perhaps after your mother died.
After my mother died.
you know what he toId me?
there's reaIIy nothing to be said.'' Oh.
weII.
he was bad with emotion.
I was 1 1.
UncIe Peter.
When we get down to the Iower IeveIs.
the pain wiII be Iess intense.
And if he dies?
Worst-case scenario?
When he wakes up.
his mind is compIeteIy gone.
Cobb.
I'II stiII honor the arrangement.
COBB: I appreciate that.
Daito.
But when you wake up.
you won't even remember that we had an arrangement.
Limbo is gonna become your reaIity.
You're gonna be Iost down there so Iong that you're gonna become an oId man.
FiIIed with regret?
Waiting to die aIone.
No.
I'II come back.
And we'II be young men together again.
Breathe.
These peopIe are gonna kiII us if we don't give them the combination.
They're gonna Iock us in that van.
and then drive it into the river.
AII right.
What is in the safe?
Domething for you.
Maurice aIways said it was his most precious gift to you.
That's an aIternate.
This wouId supersede the other if you want it to.
It spIits up the component businesses of Fischer Morrow.
It'd be the end of the entire empire as we know it.
Destroying my whoIe inheritance?
He Ioved you.
Robert.
In his own way.
FIDCHER: In his own way.
At the end...
He couId bareIy speak.
But he took the troubIe to teII me one Iast thing.
He puIIed me cIose.
And I couId onIy make out...
When were you in Iimbo?
You might have the rest of the team convinced to carry on with this job.
The truth that.
at any minute.
you might bring a freight train through the waII.
The truth that MaI is bursting through your subconscious.
And the truth that.
as we go deeper into Fischer...
And I'm not sure we're gonna Iike what we find.
We were working together.
We were expIoring the concept of a dream within a dream.
I kept pushing things.
I wanted to go deeper and deeper.
I wanted to go further.
I just didn't understand the concept that hours couId turn into years down there...
of our own subconscious...
We created.
We buiIt the worId for ourseIves.
How Iong were you stuck there?
Domething Iike 50 years.
Jesus.
How couId you stand it?
It wasn't so bad at first.
feeIing Iike gods.
EventuaIIy.
it just became impossibIe for me to Iive Iike that.
And what about for her?
Limbo became her reaIity.
What happened when you woke up?
WeII.
to wake up from that after years.
after decades...
EventuaIIy.
she toId me the truth.
That our worId wasn't reaI.
That she needed to wake up to come back to reaIity...
MAL: I'm their mother!
COBB: CaIm down.
I can teII the difference.
If this is my dream.
why can't I controI this?
You don't know you're dreaming!
COBB: <i>She was certain</i> no matter how much I pIeaded.
Dhe wanted to do it.
but she couId not do it aIone.
Just-- Just step back inside.
AII right?
Just step back inside now.
come on.
No.
I'm going to jump.
and you're coming with me.
No.
I'm not.
Now.
you Iisten to me.
If you jump.
you're not gonna wake up.
remember?
You're gonna die.
Now.
just step back inside.
Come on.
Dtep back inside so we can taIk about this.
We've taIked enough.
We're gonna taIk about this.
AII right?
No.
I can't.
You know I can't do that.
Take a second.
think about our chiIdren.
Think about James.
Think about PhiIIipa.
now.
If I go without you.
they'II take them away anyway.
for my safety.
How you've threatened to kiII me.
Why did--?
Why wouId you do this to me?
I've freed you from the guiIt of choosing to Ieave them.
We're going home to our reaI chiIdren.
Oh.
no.
no.
no.
MaI.
you Iisten to me.
aII right?
MaI.
Iook at me.
pIease?
You're waiting for a train.
James and PhiIIipa are waiting for you!
You know where you hope this train wiII take you.
but you can't know for sure.
Dweetheart!
Look at me!
MaI.
no!
Jesus Christ!
Dhe had herseIf decIared sane by three different psychiatrists.
It made it impossibIe for me to try to expIain the nature of her madness.
MAN: Right now.
or never.
Cobb.
WOMAN: James!
PhiIIipa!
Come on in!
Come on!
AII right.
Iet's go.
I Ieft my chiIdren behind and I've been trying to buy my way back ever since.
Your guiIt defines her.
It's what powers her.
But you are not responsibIe for the idea that destroyed her.
And if we are gonna succeed in this...
and you're gonna have to confront her.
But you don't have to do that aIone.
Because they have no idea the risk they've taken coming down here with you.
We have to move.
Time's up.
AII right.
I don't know any combination.
COBB: How about instinctiveIy.
huh?
I got somebody in your father's office right now ready to tap in the combination.
Give me the first six numbers that come to your head right now.
I said.
right now!
Right now!
Five.
two.
eight.
four.
nine.
one.
You'II have to do better than that.
AII right.
Bag them.
You're going for a ride.
FIDCHER: We're worth more to you aIive.
You hear me?
What'd you get?
ReIationship with his father is worse than we imagined.
This heIps us how?
The stronger the issues.
the more powerfuI the catharsis.
Work faster.
The projections are cIosing in quick.
We gotta break out of here before we're totaIIy boxed in.
Damn it.
You mustn't be afraid to dream a IittIe bigger.
darIing.
We need to shift his animosity from his father to his godfather.
true nature.
We shouId charge Fischer a Iot more than Daito for this job.
His security is gonna get worse as we go deeper.
EAMED: Who's Mr.
CharIes?
The second we get into that hoteI his security's gonna be aII over us.
We run with Mr.
CharIes Iike on the Dtein job.
ARTHUR: Yeah.
and it didn't work.
The subject reaIized he was dreaming and his subconscious tore us to pieces.
ExceIIent.
But you Iearned a Iot.
right?
EAMED: No probIem.
How about a IoveIy Iady that I've used before?
Listen to me.
You drive carefuIIy.
aII right?
Everything down there is gonna be unstabIe as heII.
Don't jump too soon.
We onIy got one shot at that kick.
We gotta make it.
I'II pIay the music to Iet you know it's coming.
The rest is on you.
Dweet dreams.
WOMAN: Am I boring you?
I was teIIing you my story.
I guess it wasn't to your Iiking.
Um.
I have a Iot on my mind.
There goes Mr.
CharIes.
Mr.
Fischer.
right?
PIeasure to see you again.
Rod Green from marketing.
I-- Hmm.
In case you get bored.
Must've bIown you off.
That is.
unIess her phone number reaIIy is onIy six digits.
Funny way to make friends.
someone steaIing your waIIet Iike that.
Goddamn it.
The waIIet aIone is worth at Ieast 500-- About $500.
right?
Don't worry about it.
My peopIe are aIready on it as we speak.
Who or what is Mr.
CharIes?
It's a gambit designed to turn Fischer against his own subconscious.
ARIADNE: And why don't you approve?
It invoIves teIIing the mark that he's dreaming...
a Iot of attention to us.
Do now you've noticed how much time...
he says never to do.
Mr.
Daito.
can I have a moment?
MAN: HoId on!
Wait!
You Iook a bit perkier.
Very amusing.
Mr.
Eames.
TurbuIence on the pIane?
No.
it's much cIoser.
That's Yusuf's driving.
Um.
I'm sorry.
Who did you say you were?
COBB: Rod Green from marketing.
But that's not true at aII.
is it?
My name is Mr.
CharIes.
You remember me.
don't you?
I'm the head of your security down here.
Get out on a different fIoor.
keep moving.
Dump the waIIet.
Decurity wiII be Iooking for that.
Decurity.
huh?
I speciaIize in a very specific type of security.
Dubconscious security.
You're taIking about dreams?
Are you taIking about.
um.
extraction?
I am here to protect you.
Mr.
Fischer.
I'm here to protect you in the event...
your mind through your dreams.
You're not safe here.
They're coming for you.
Dtrange weather.
isn't it?
You feeI that?
What's happening?
Cobb's drawing Fischer's attention to the strangeness of the dream...
Iook for the dreamer.
For me.
Quick.
give me a kiss.
We shouId probabIy get out of here.
COBB: You feeI that?
You've actuaIIy been trained for this.
Mr.
Fischer.
Pay attention to the strangeness of the weather.
the shift in gravity.
None of this is reaI.
You're in a dream.
Now.
the easiest way for you to test yourseIf...
at this hoteI.
Can you do that?
Yeah.
I....
COBB: No.
breathe.
breathe.
Remember your training.
Accept the fact that you're in a dream.
and I'm here to protect you.
Go on.
Mm-hm.
No.
I'm a projection of your subconscious.
I was sent here to protect you in the event...
tried to puII you into a dream.
And I beIieve that's what's going on right now.
Mr.
Fischer.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
Can you get me out of here?
Right away.
FoIIow me.
HoId on a second.
Jesus Christ!
What are you doing?
These men were sent here to abduct you.
aII right?
If you want my heIp.
you have to remain caIm.
I need you to work with me.
Mr.
Fischer.
If this is a dream.
I shouId just kiII myseIf to wake up.
right?
I wouIdn't do that if I were you.
Mr.
Fischer.
I beIieve they have you sedated.
and if you puII that trigger...
You may go into a further dream state.
Now.
you know what I'm taIking about.
You remember the training.
Remember what I said to you.
Give me the gun.
Think.
Mr.
Fischer.
think.
What do you remember from before this dream?
There was.
um.
a Iot of gunfire.
There was rain.
UncIe Peter.
You're in the back of a van.
Keep going.
It had something to do with.
um....
Domething to do with a safe.
God.
why is it so hard to remember?
It's Iike trying to remember a dream after you've woken up.
Listen.
it takes years of practice.
You and Browning have been puIIed into this dream...
something from your mind.
I need you to focus and try and remember what that is.
What is it.
Mr.
Fischer?
Think!
A combination.
They demanded the first numbers to pop into my head.
They're trying to extract a number from your subconscious.
It can represent anything.
We're in a hoteI right now.
We shouId try hoteI rooms.
What was the number.
Mr.
Fischer?
Try and remember for me.
This is very important.
Five.
Five.
two-- It was something.
it was a Iong number.
That's good.
We can start there.
Fifth fIoor.
Yep.
WhiIe you're aII asIeep in 528.
I wait for Yusuf's kick.
And then when the van hits the barrier of the bridge.
that shouId be unmistakabIe.
Do we get a nice synchronized kick.
If it's too soon.
we won't get puIIed out.
But if it's too Iate.
I won't be abIe to drop us.
They're with me.
Go on.
Mr.
CharIes.
They were trying to put you under.
What do you mean.
a dream within a dream?
Hey.
I see you've changed.
I'm sorry?
Oh.
I'm sorry.
I mistook you for a friend.
Oh.
Good-Iooking feIIow.
I'm sure.
No.
no.
no.
That's Fischer's projection of Browning.
Let's foIIow him and see how he behaves.
his motives the way we want him to.
Dhh.
WeII.
not exactIy.
They aIready had him.
They were torturing him.
And you saw them torture him?
The kidnappers are working for you?
Robert.
You're trying to get that safe open?
To get the aIternate wiII?
Fischer Morrow has been my entire Iife.
I can't Iet you destroy it.
I'm not gonna throw away my inheritance.
I couIdn't Iet you rise to your father's Iast taunt.
That's his Iast insuIt.
A chaIIenge for you to buiId something for yourseIf...
of his accompIishments.
But he's wrong.
You can buiId a better company than he ever did.
Mr.
Fischer?
He's Iying.
He's hiding something.
and we need to find out what that is.
I need you to do the same thing to him that he was going to do to you.
We'II enter his subconscious and find out what he doesn't want you to know.
AII right.
COBB: He's out.
Whose subconscious are we going into exactIy?
We're going into Fischer's.
I toId him it was Browning's so he'd be a part of our team.
He's gonna heIp us break into his own subconscious.
COBB: That's right.
Decurity's gonna run you down hard.
And I wiII Iead them on a merry chase.
ARTHUR: You good?
Hey.
You ready?
Yes.
yes.
I'm fine.
I'm ready.
ARIADNE: Cobb?
Cobb?
What's down there?
HopefuIIy.
the truth we want Fischer to Iearn.
I mean.
what's down there for you?
Did you see that?
COBB: Eames.
this is your dream.
I need you to draw the security away from the compIex.
understand?
COBB: Not me.
If I know the route.
everything couId be compromised.
COBB: No.
you're with me.
DAITO: I couId do it.
AII right.
Brief him on the route into the compIex.
You keep this Iive.
I'II be Iistening in the whoIe time.
The windows on that upper fIoor are big enough for me to cover you from that tower.
FIDCHER: You're not coming in?
In order to find out the truth about your father...
Browning's mind on your own.
DAITO: Come on.
Fischer!
Move!
Go!
YUDUF: Dod it.
I hope you're ready.
No.
it's too soon.
Cobb.
do you hear that?
I first noticed it about 20 minutes ago.
I thought it was the wind up here.
Yeah.
I hear it.
It's music.
Do.
what do we do?
We move fast.
Yusuf's 10 seconds from the jump.
Which gives Arthur three minutes.
Then they need a new route.
a more direct route.
It's designed as a Iabyrinth.
There must be access routes that cut through the maze.
Eames?
Did Eames add any features?
I don't think I shouId teII you.
We don't have time for this.
Did he add anything?
He added an air-duct system that can cut through the maze.
Good.
ExpIain it to them.
ARIADNE: <i>Saito?</i> Paradox.
ARIADNE: What was that?
Cobb!
Cobb.
did we miss it?
Yeah.
we missed it.
FIDCHER: Man.
CouIdn't someone have dreamt up a goddamn beach?
Huh?
Uh-huh.
EAMED [OVER RADIO]: We finish the job before the next kick.
WOMAN [ON RECORDING]: <i>lf you'd like to</i> How do I drop you without gravity?
Arthur has a coupIe minutes.
and we have about 20.
You okay?
DOLDIER: Run!
Turn around!
Move to base!
Move to base!
Go.
go.
go!
There's something wrong.
They're heading your way.
Iike they know something.
Just buy us more time.
aII right?
DOLDIER: Come on!
Move!
AII right.
Okay.
That's the antechamber outside the strong room.
Let's hope Fischer Iikes what he finds in there.
There's an entire army headed your way.
I'm in.
DOLDIER: There he is.
Come on.
Come on.
a IittIe Iower.
ARIADNE: Cobb.
No.
she is not reaI.
How do you know that?
Dhe is just a projection.
Fischer.
Fischer is reaI.
HeIIo.
ARIADNE: Eames!
Eames.
get to the antechamber now!
EAMED: What happened?
I couIdn't shoot her.
There's no use in reviving him.
His mind's aIready trapped down there.
It's aII over.
Do that's it.
then?
We faiIed?
We're done.
I'm sorry.
It's not me that doesn't get back to my famiIy.
is it?
Dhame.
I wanted to know what was gonna happen in there.
I swear we had this.
Let's set the charges.
No.
there's stiII another way.
No.
but there wiII be enough time down there.
And we wiII find him.
Okay.
as soon as Arthur's music kicks in.
just use the defibriIIator to revive him.
We can give him his own kick down beIow.
Look.
you get him in there.
As soon as the music ends.
you bIow up the hospitaI...
back up the Iayers.
It's worth a shot.
if Daito can hoId the guards off whiIe I set the charges.
Daito wiII never make it.
wiII he?
If you are not back before the kick.
I am gone with or without you.
Dhe's right.
Dhe's right.
Come on.
Let's go.
Can I trust you to do what needs to happen here?
MaI's gonna be down there.
I know where to find her.
Dhe'II have Fischer.
Dhe wants me back down there with her.
AII right?
And this is where she'II be.
Come on.
Daito.
Daito.
I need you to take care of Fischer whiIe I go set some charges.
okay?
No room for tourists on these jobs.
Don't be siIIy.
ARIADNE: You buiIt aII this?
This is incredibIe.
We buiIt for years.
Then we started in on the memories.
This way.
COBB: This was our neighborhood.
PIaces from our past.
That was our first apartment.
Then we moved to that buiIding right there.
After MaI became pregnant.
that became our home.
You reconstructed aII of this from memory?
Like I toId you.
we had Iots of time.
ARIADNE: What is that?
That's the house MaI grew up in.
Come on.
We both wanted to Iive in a house.
but we Ioved this type of buiIding.
In the reaI worId.
we'd have to choose.
but not here.
How are we gonna bring Fischer back?
We're gonna have to come up with some kind of a kick.
What?
I'm gonna improvise.
Listen.
there's something you shouId know about me.
About inception.
An idea is Iike a virus.
ResiIient.
HighIy contagious.
And the smaIIest seed of an idea can grow.
It can grow to define...
MAL: The smaIIest idea.
such as: DimpIe IittIe thought that changes everything.
Do certain of your worId.
Of what's reaI.
Do you think he is?
Or do you think he's as Iost as I was?
COBB: I know what's reaI.
MaI.
No creeping doubts?
Not feeIing persecuted.
Dom?
Chased around the gIobe...
and poIice forces...
persecute the dreamer?
Admit it.
You don't beIieve in one reaIity anymore.
Do choose.
Choose to be here.
Choose me.
You know what I have to do.
I have to get back to our chiIdren because you Ieft them.
Because you Ieft us.
COBB: I'm not wrong.
You're confused.
Our chiIdren are here.
And you'd Iike to see their faces again.
wouIdn't you?
Yes.
but I'm gonna see them up above.
MaI.
Up above?
Listen to yourseIf.
These are our chiIdren.
Watch.
James?
PhiIIipa?
Don't do this.
MaI.
PIease.
Those aren't my chiIdren.
You keep teIIing yourseIf that.
but you don't beIieve it.
What if I'm what's reaI?
You keep teIIing yourseIf what you know.
But what do you beIieve?
What do you feeI?
GuiIt.
I feeI guiIt.
MaI.
And no matter what I do.
no matter how hopeIess I am...
that guiIt is aIways there...
What truth?
That the idea that caused you to question your reaIity came from me.
You pIanted the idea in my mind?
What is she taIking about?
The reason I knew inception was possibIe was because I did it to her first.
We were Iost in here.
And she couIdn't break free.
That death was the onIy escape.
You're waiting for a train.
A train that'II take you far away.
You know where you hope this train wiII take you...
Yet it doesn't matter.
COBB: <i>But l never knew that that idea</i> That even after you came back to reaIity...
your worId wasn't reaI.
That death was the onIy escape.
MaI.
no!
Jesus!
You betrayed me.
But you can make amends.
You can stiII keep your promise.
We can stiII be together.
right here...
Cobb.
we need to get Fischer.
You can't have him.
Fischer is on the porch.
Go check he's aIive right now.
Do it.
He's here!
And it's time.
but you have to come now!
COBB: You take Fischer with you.
aII right?
I'm not.
Daito's dead by now.
That means he's down here somewhere.
That means I have to find him.
I can't stay with her anymore.
because she doesn't exist.
I'm the onIy thing you do beIieve in anymore.
No.
I wish.
I wish more than anything.
but...
with aII your compIexity...
aII your imperfection.
Look at you.
You're just a shade.
You're just a shade of my reaI wife.
And you were the best that I couId do.
but...
Does this feeI reaI?
No.
no.
no!
In there.
now.
Go.
go.
go.
I was dis-- I was dis-- Disa-- I know you were disappointed...
No.
No.
no.
no.
I was disappointed...
What?
Come on.
come on.
Dad?
That's the kick.
Ariadne!
You have to go now!
Don't Iose yourseIf!
Find Daito and bring him back!
I wiII!
You remember when you asked me to marry you?
Yes.
You said you dreamt that we'd grow oId together.
But we did.
I miss you more than I can bear...
And I have to Iet you go.
I have to Iet you go.
I'm sorry.
Robert.
You know.
the wiII means that Dad wanted me to be my own man...
That's what I'm gonna do.
UncIe Peter.
What happened?
No.
to find Daito.
He'II be Iost.
No.
he'II be aII right.
DAITO: Have you come to kiII me?
I'm waiting for someone.
COBB: Domeone from a haIf-remembered dream.
Cobb?
ImpossibIe.
We were young men together.
I'm an oId man.
FiIIed with regret.
Waiting to die aIone.
I've come back for you.
To remind you of something.
Domething you once knew.
That this worId is not reaI.
To convince me to honor our arrangement?
To take a Ieap of faith.
yes.
Come back...
young men together again.
Come back with me.
Come back.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Hot toweI.
sir?
We'II be Ianding in Los AngeIes in about 20 minutes.
Do you need immigration forms?
Thank you.
Hot toweI.
sir?
WeIcome home.
Mr.
Cobb.
Thank you.
sir.
WeIcome.
This way.
MILED: James?
PhiIIipa?
Look who's here.
Hey.
PHILLIPA: Daddy!
Daddy!
JAMED: Daddy!
COBB: How are you?
Look what I've been buiIding!
JAMED: We're buiIding a house on the cIiff!
COBB: On the cIiff?
Come on.
I want you to show me.
Can you show me?
JAMED: Let's go.
PHILLIPA: Come on.
Daddy!
ÿþ1  you've been here but...</i> This guy.
He's here already.
Lenny!
It's Leonard.
I guess I've already told you about my condition.
Oh, well, only every time I see you.
Oh, you're in a playful mood.
Yeah, it's just this fucked up building.
Why do you wanna go there?
Don't remember.
What are you talking about?
These tracks are only a few days old.
Tracks?
What are you, Pocahontas?
Come on.
Let's take a look inside.
He is the one.
Kill him.</i> Find anything?
Didn't think so.
Let's go, huh?
Oh, fuck this.
You're gonna pay for what you did.
Beg forgiveness and then you pay.
You don't have a clue, you freak!
Beg my wife's forgiveness before I blow your brains out.
Leonard, you don't know what's going on.
Cos you read it off a fucking picture.
You don't know who you are.
Come on, let's go down to the basement.
Let's go down, you and me together.
Then you'll know who you really are.
But you look anyway.</i> Hm.</i> and you know kind of all about yourself.</i> notes are really useful.</i> but he really had no system.</i> of notes but he'd get them all mixed up.</i> Burt.
I'm not sure, I think I may have asked you to hold my calls.
You said you like to look people in the eye when you talk to them.
Yeah, yeah.
I have no short-term memory.
I know all about myself, I just...
Since my injury I can't make new memories.
Everything fades.
If we talk for too long I'll forget how we started...
I won't remember this conversation.
I don't even know if I've met you before.
So if I seem a little strange or rude, or something, uh...
I've told you this before, haven't I?
I don't mean to mess with you but it's so weird.
What's the last thing you remember?
My wife.
What's it like?
It's like waking.
It's like you just woke up.
That must suck.
It's all backwards.
Like, maybe you got an idea about what you want to do next...
what you just did.
I mean, I'm exactly the opposite...
OK, but this guy's an exception.
You know this guy?
OK.
If he calls or shows up here, give me a call in my room, OK?
All right.
Look, I hope my condition's not gonna be a problem for you.
Not as long as you remember to pay the bill.
Yeah.
OK.
Forty.
This guy.
He's here already.
Lenny!
if you're gonna make it work.</i> It becomes an important part of your life.</i> Where you put them is really important.</i> like, six pockets...</i> for particular things.</i> things go and how the system works.</i> writing stuff for you...</i> or is gonna lead you astray.</i> take advantage...</i> which...
is...</i> on a piece of paper can be the answer.</i> Who is this?
Ah, Lincoln Street?
Just go straight out on Sixth Street...
This guy told me his name was Teddy.
Stay there.
I'll be right over.</i> White male.
First name, John.
Last name G for Gammell.
Drugs.
License plate.
SG13...
It's him.
I've found you, you fuck.
You said we talked before.
I don't remember that.
Yeah, but it's not amnesia.
I remember up until my injury, I just can't make new memories.
So I can't remember talking to you.
What did we talk about?
Oh, Sammy Jankis.
I guess I tell people about Sammy to help them understand.
Sammy's story helps me understand my own situation.
Sammy wrote himself endless amounts of notes.
But he got mixed up.
I have a more graceful solution to the memory problem.
I'm disciplined and organised.
I use habit and routine to make my life possible.
Sammy had no drive...
Me?
Yeah...
She will help you out of pity.</i> Please call me Leonard.
My wife called me Lenny.
Yeah.
Do you mind taking your glasses off?
It's hard for me to...
Thanks.
So, you have information for me?
Must be tough living your life according to a couple of scraps of paper.
Mix your laundry list with your grocery list and you'll end up eating your underwear.
I guess that's why you have those freaky tattoos.
Yeah, it's tough.
It's almost impossible.
Look, I'm sorry I don't remember you.
It's nothing personal.
I do have information for you.
You gave me a license-plate number.
Had my friend at DMV trace it.
Guess what name came up?
John Edward Gammell.
John G.
Do you know him?
No.
But his face on his driver's licence looked really familiar.
I think he's been in the bar, maybe.
Here's a copy of his licence, his registration, photo and all.
Are you sure you want this?
Well, then you shouldn't have to ask.
Even if you get revenge, you're not gonna remember it.
You're not even gonna know it happened.
My wife deserves vengeance.
It doesn't make any difference if I know about it.
Just because there are things I don't remember...
The world doesn't just disappear when you close your eyes.
Anyway, maybe I'll take a photograph to remind myself.
Get another freaky tattoo.
Tell me about her again.
Why?
Because you like to remember her.
She was beautiful.
Don't just recite the words.
Close your eyes and remember her.
You can just feel the details.
The bits and pieces you never bothered to put into words.
And you can feel these extreme moments.
and you get the feel of a person.</i> Enough to know how much you miss them.
who took them away.</i> I, um, I added an address in here.
It might be useful.
It's an abandoned place outside of town.
Um, I guy I knew used to do bigger deals there.
It's isolated.
Sounds perfect.
See, you have this condition.
You still staying at the Discount Inn?
Room 304?
Left it at my place.
Yeah.
You know what we have in common?
We are both survivors.
You take care, Leonard.
I met Sammy through work.
Insurance.
I was an investigator.
I'd investigate the claims to see which ones were phoney.
I had to see through people's bullshit.
It was useful experience cos now it's my life.
When I meet someone, I don't know if I've met them before.
I have to look in their eyes and try and figure them out.
what someone knew was let them talk.</i> experts tell you it means they're lying.</i> get nervous for all sorts of reasons.</i> Yeah, I was good.
Sammy was my first real challenge.
Yo, Lenny!
I thought you'd split for good.
Only every time I see ya.
Come on, I'll buy you lunch.
I'm sick of hearing about the guy.
What about John G?
You think he's still here?
You mentioned that maybe somebody was trying to set you up.
Get you to kill the wrong guy.
I go on facts, not recommendations, but thank you.
Lenny, you can't trust a man's life to your little notes and pictures.
No, really.
Memory's not perfect, it's not even that good.
Ask the police.
Eyewitness testimony is unreliable.
The cops don't catch a killer by sitting around remembering stuff.
Facts, not memories.
That's how you investigate.
I know, it's what I used to do.
Memory can change the shape of a room, it can change the colour of a car.
And memories can be distorted.
They're an interpretation, not a record.
They're irrelevant if you have the facts.
You really want to get this guy, don't you?
He killed my wife.
He took away my fucking memory.
He destroyed my ability to live.
You're living.
Only for revenge.
Well, then we'll get the bastard.
Where are you staying?
The Discount Inn.
I don't know what room.
I haven't got my key.
Probably left it in your room.
Hi.
I'm checked in here but I think I've misplaced my key.
How you doing, Leonard?
Probably in the room, right?
You're in 304.
I'm sorry.
I fucked up.
Then why is this my handwriting?
Well...
this "was" your room but now you're in 304.
Business is slow, I mean, I told my boss about your condition and stuff...
So how many rooms am I checked into in this shit hole?
Just two.
So far.
Well...
about ripping me off.
Leonard.
Always get a receipt.
Oh, yeah.
I'll write that down.
Excuse me.
Your room's...
I'd just become an investigator when I came across Sammy.
Mr Samuel R Jankis, strangest case ever.
The guy's a 58-year-old, semiretired accountant.
He and his wife were in this car accident, nothing serious.
he can't get a handle on what's going on.</i> to the hippocampus, nothing conclusive.</i> for more than a couple of minutes.</i> the insurance company and I get sent in.</i> so I really check into it.</i> but he can't make new memories.</i> for a couple of minutes.</i> a couple of minutes was too confusing...</i> Sammy.
It's time for my shot.
the plot of Green Acres anymore...</i> before the accident...</i> on what he was doing.</i> memory loss, or short-term memory loss.</i> Sammy, it's OK.
I got it.
and I'm thinking "bad actor".</i> So now I'm suspicious and I order more tests.
It's only me.
Oh, shit.
Shit.
I gotta be someplace.
It's pretty weird.
It's useful.
You never write a phone number on your hand?
I, um, I should be able to talk to my friend today...
John G's license plate.
You have it tattooed on your thigh.
She will help you out of pity.</i> If it's registered in this state...
to pull up his licence and registration.
I'll call you as soon as I talk to him.
Could we arrange a meeting now?
I'm not too good on the phone.
You know, it's great that you...
Well, that you're...
I'm helping you because you helped me.
So next time you see me...
I think you will.
I'm sorry.
Lenny, before you go, could I have my shirt back, please?
Yo, Lenny!
I thought you'd split for good.
Sammy couldn't pick up any new skills at all.
But I find something in my research.
Conditioning.
Sammy should still be able to learn through repetition.
It's how you learn stuff like riding a bike.
You get better through practice.
It's a different part of the brain from the short-term memory.
So I had the doctors test Sammy's response to conditioning.
Where were you guys when I did my CPA?
Sorry.
Ta-da!
They'd give him a shock.</i> They kept repeating the test, always with the same objects electrified.
The point was to see if Sammy could learn to avoid the electrified objects...
Natalie, right?
Who the fuck is Dodd?
Guess I don't have to worry about him any more.
This is my problem.
You offered to help.
It's nothing to do with your investigation.
How did you get me into this?
You offered to help me when you saw what he did to my face.
I showed you what he did and I asked you to help me.
Something doesn't feel right.
I think someone's fucking with me, trying to get me to kill the wrong guy.
Kill him?
This has nothing to do with you.
You helped me out and I'm grateful.
You have to burn them.
Leonard, you decided to help me.
Trust your own judgement.
You can question everything, you can never know anything for sure.
I know what that's gonna sound like when I knock on it.
I know what that's gonna feel like when I pick it up.
See?
Certainties.
It's the kind of memory you take for granted.
You know, I can remember so much.
The feel of the world...
And her.
She's gone.
And the present is trivia which I scribble down as fucking notes.
Hey, come on.
Try and relax.
Come on.
Come on, take your jacket off.
Here.
Come on.
Hey.
Didn't think you were the type.
It's backwards.
Come here.
Come here.
What about here?
Maybe it's...
for when I find him.
I've lost somebody too.
I'm sorry.
His name was Jimmy.
He never came back.
What do the police think?
They don't look too hard for guys like Jimmy.
When you find this guy, this...
I'm gonna kill him.
Maybe I can help you find him.
I don't even know how long she's been gone.
It's like I've woken up in bed and she's not here...
or something.
But somehow I just...
I just know she's never gonna come back to bed.
If I could just...
and touch her side of the bed...
But I can't.
I know I can't have her back.
But I don't want to wake up in the morning thinking she's still here.
I lie here not knowing how long I've been alone.
So how...
How can I heal?
How am I supposed to heal if I can't...
She will help you out of pity.</i> They kept testing Sammy for months.
carrying the electrical charge.</i> Even with total short-term memory loss...
to stop picking up the wrong objects.
Sammy didn't respond at all.</i> was psychological not physical.</i> We turned down his claim on the grounds that he wasn't covered for mental illness.
His wife got stuck with the bills and I got a big promotion.
Conditioning didn't work for Sammy, so he became helpless.
But it works for me.
I live the way Sammy couldn't.
Habit and routine make my life possible.
Conditioning.
Acting on instinct.
Oh.
But I'll take a look anyway.</i> Open the door!
Open the door!
Come on!
You called me.
You said you needed my help.
You know, I've had more rewarding friendships than this one.
Although I do get to keep telling the same jokes.
What the fuck is that?
Who the fuck is that?
You don't think so?
You didn't write it down?
Ask him.
What's your name?
Your name?
You did.
OK, Natalie.
Who's Natalie?
Natalie who?
Look, we gotta get him out of here.
All right, all right, all right.
He's got to have a car, right?
We take him to his car, tell him to get the fuck out of town or we're gonna kill him.
We can't walk him out of here tied up and bleeding.
Yes, I do.
This is not my room.
It must be his room.
Great.
Let's go.
Because the maid's gonna walk in.
She'll see him, call the cops.
He can ID us.
OK.
We untie him, we clean him up...
with a gun in his back.
A gun.
Why would I have a gun?
It must be his.
I don't think they'd let someone like me carry a gun.
Fucking hope not.
Which one?
We should probably steal his car.
You know, teach him a lesson.
All right, get in.
I'm gonna ride with him, you follow us.
Give me your keys.
Take your own car.
So was he scared?
I think it was your sinister moustache.
Fuck you.
Should have stolen his car.
So what do you do now?
I'm gonna find out what the fuck that was all about.
Natalie, right?
Who the fuck is Dodd?
Sammy's wife was crippled by the cost of supporting him.
And fighting the company's decision.
But it wasn't the money that got to her.
Sammy, I have an idea.
not physical.</i> You're gonna have a pen in your pocket.
We're gonna deal with it.
We're gonna try a little harder.
and sees the same person...</i> he should snap out of it.</i> Ellen called.
Ellen...
Ellen can't come today!
So, Leonard Shelby from the insurance company gives her the seed of doubt.
Just like he gave it to the doctors.
But I never said that he was faking.
I never said that.
or just get rid of him for Natalie.</i> you know what to do.</i> I'm at the Mount Crest Inn on Fifth Street, room six.
I need you to come over as soon as you get this.
It's important.
Oh, this is Leonard.
Thanks.
Bye.
Phew!
Fuck!
Mrs Jankis didn't understand that you can't bully someone into remembering.
The more pressure you're under, the harder it gets.
Ah.
Well, then, call me back?
Ah!
Fuck!
Mount Crest Inn on Fifth Street.</i> Oh, fuck!
Sorry.
What, I haven't made a strong enough impression on you?
Who is this?
Ouch!
Cut it out.
I thought the pleasure of a book was in wanting to know what happens next.
Don't be a prick.
I'm not reading it to annoy you.
I enjoy it.
Just let me read.
Please?
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Well, sir, that'd certainly be in keeping with some of my own discoveries.
I was hoping for more on the drugs angle.
Will you hang on a sec?
The police report mentioned the drugs found in the car outside my house.
The car was stolen.
His prints were all over it.
I got friends in the department.
They gave me a copy.
I dealt with the police a lot in my insurance job.
With my condition it's really tough.
I can't keep it all in mind at once.
I have to summarise the sections.
There are pages missing.
I guess I've been trying to log them all.
I don't know why these are crossed out.
They weren't even looking for John G.
The stuff they found in the car fit in with what they believed had happened...
Honey?
Honey, it's late.
Everything OK?
Was it good for you?
What?
Was I supposed to lock the door?
No.
I'd like you to leave now.
There's something about the drugs stashed in the car that doesn't ring true.
The police claim the guy was an addict needing money to score.
It's bullshit.
He's not gonna go breaking into places while he's still got a stash that big.
Well, I think John G left it there.
Or planted it there.
How do you know that?
Oh, shit, that's true.
It fits.
So he's a dealer.
Hang on a sec.
Now we're getting somewhere.
Yeah, OK.
Blonde's fine.
Well, that's what they say.
The Discount Inn.
304.
Leonard.
Well, what then?
We just go to bed.
You wait for me to fall asleep.
You go into the bathroom and slam the door.
Ah...
Yeah, first I just need you to put these things around the room.
Pretend they're your things and this is your bedroom.
I don't want you to use it.
I'm sorry.
I just mean put them around the room, as if they were your...
your things.
Whatever gets you off.
I can't blame the cops for not taking me seriously.
This is a difficult condition to understand.
Look at Sammy Jankis.
His own wife couldn't deal with it.
I told you how she tried to get him to snap out of it.
She came to see me at the office.
I found out all kinds of shit.
How she treated him.</i> Thank you for seeing me.
She'd get Sammy to hide food around the house...
if his hunger would make him remember.
I've taken him to a parking lot and, uh...
She just wanted her old Sammy back.</i> You know all about Sammy and you've decided he's faking.
The company's position isn't that Sammy's faking anything...
can't be shown to be...
I just want to know your honest opinion about Sammy.
We shouldn't be talking like this while the case is still open to appeal.
Try to understand, when I look at Sammy, I don't see some...
vegetable.
I see my same old Sammy.
What do you think that's like for me...
this whole problem?
That if I just could say the right thing...
and go back to being normal.
If I...
If I knew that my old Sammy were truly gone...
and start loving this new Sammy.
As long as I have doubt I can't say goodbye and move on.
What do you want from me?
I want you to forget the company you work for for thirty seconds...
that Sammy's faking his condition.
I need to know...
I believe that Sammy should be physically capable of making new memories.
Thank you.
I thought she just needed an answer.
I didn't think it was important what it was.
Just that she had one to believe.
Remember Sammy?
You told me about Sammy!
What, your sense of humour went with the memory?
Do you know why you're here?
your business here is very much finished.
Schmuck!
Whose house do you think you just walked out of?
That's right, take a look at your pictures.
I bet you got one of her.
Oh, nice shot, Leibovitz(!) You'll want to make a note.
You can't trust her.
Why's that?
Because by now she's taken a look at the suit and the car...
of turning the situation to her advantage.
She's already got you staying with her, for Christ sakes.
You can't go back there.
Let me give you the name of a motel.
You're lucky I ran into you.
That broad's bad news.
Look.
See these?
This is the bar where she works.
Her boyfriend's a drug dealer.
She takes orders for him, arranges meets.
He writes messages on the back of these...
when she serves him his drinks.
From who?
Guys are gonna wanna know what happened to her boyfriend.
Guys are gonna come after her.
Somebody's got to pay, Lenny.
Somebody always pays.
Maybe she'll make it you.
Oh, yeah?
Well, maybe she'll make it you.
Is that it?
You worried that she's gonna use me against you?
Because she doesn't know who I am.
She doesn't know anything about your investigation.
OK, Einstein?
So write this down.
When she offers to help, it'll be for her own reasons.
I'm not lying.
Take my pen, write this down.
Do not trust her.
There.
You happy now?
You ever wonder how long you can hang around here...
The same questions you should be asking yourself.
My wife's death.
I used to work in insurance.
We were well covered.
Oh!
So in your grief you wandered into a Jaguar dealership?
You don't have a clue, do you?
You don't even know who you are.
Yes, I do.
I don't have amnesia.
I remember everything right up until the incident.
I am Leonard Shelby, I am from San Francisco...
That's who you were.
You do not know who you are.
What you've become since...
You wander around playing detective.
You don't even know how long ago it was.
Let me put it this way.
Were you wearing designer suits when you sold insurance?
Look, do me a favour, don't go back in there.
Will you take the motel out of town?
It's been fun, Lenny.
Oh, fuck it.
I need my own place.
No.
She shouldn't have given me that responsibility.
I'm a claims investigator, not a doctor.
Yeah, yeah, I guess.
I've got all sorts of other considerations.
Legal responsibility, large financ...
Write this down.
Write down what happened.
Keep it in mind.
Find a p...</i> Who?
Who?
Fuck, Leonard, Dodd!
Dodd beat the shit out of me.
Why?
Because of you!
Because I did what you told me to do, reason with him...
You're safe.
It's OK.
Come on.
Just sit down.
Sit down.
Here, sit down.
OK.
You're OK.
I'll just get some ice for your face.
Here.
I did exactly what you told me to do.
I went to Dodd...
that I didn't have any of Jimmy's money...
And that this Teddy must have taken everything.
And what did he say?
He didn't believe me.
He said if I don't have the drugs by tomorrow, he's gonna kill me.
And then he just...
he just started hitting me.
Where is he?
I'll give him some bruises of his own and tell him to look for a guy called Teddy.
Oh, he'll kill you, Lenny.
Yeah, I hated it.
Oh, this guy is so dangerous.
Let's just think of something else, OK?
No, no, no.
You just tell me what he looks like.
And where I can find him.
Have you got a pen?
In my purse.
He'll, um...
he'll probably find you.
What do you mean?
I told him about your car.
Why?
He was beating the shit out of me, I had to tell him something.
Just write it all down.
Be careful.
I'll be fine.
Front desk?
Burt, right.
This is Mr Shelby in room 21.
Yeah, that's it, I don't want any calls.
No, none at all.
What does he want?
Wants to know what happened to Jimmy and his money.
He thinks I took it.
Did you?
No.
You're just blissfully ignorant, aren't you?
I probably know more about it than you, you don't have a clue about anything else.
He took a lot of money with him and never came back.
Jimmy's partners think I set him up.
I don't know if you know this Teddy.
What do you think I am?
I'm not gonna kill someone for money.
What, then?
Love?
What would you kill for?
I can talk about whoever the fuck I want!
I can say whatever I want and you won't remember!
I can call your wife a fucking whore and we can still be friends.
You don't know how, you fucking idiot!
This has nothing to do with me.
How the fuck would you know?
You don't know a fucking thing!
You pathetic piece of shit!
I can say whatever the fuck I want and you won't have a clue, you fucking retard!
I'm gonna use you.
I'm telling you now because I'm gonna enjoy it much more...
if you weren't such a fucking freak.
Did you lose your pen?
Too bad, freak.
Otherwise you could write yourself a note about how much Natalie hates your guts...
I read about your condition, Leonard.
You know one of the causes of short-term memory loss?
Venereal disease.
Maybe your cunt of a fucking wife...
and turned you into a retard!
You sad, sad freak.
I can say whatever the fuck I want and you won't remember.
We'll still be best friends.
Or maybe even lovers.
Fuck!
I'll see you soon.
I'm gonna write it down.</i> keep it in mind, keep it in mind.</i> I've got to find a pen.</i> Exactly what happened.</i> Come on, come on!
I've got to find a pen!</i> Come on, find a pen.</i> Write down what happened.
Write it down.</i> Keep it in mind.
Find a p...</i> What happened?
What does it look like?
He beat the shit out of me.
Fuck, Leonard, Dodd!
Dodd beat the shit out of me.
It's Burt, from the front desk.
Yeah?
I know you said you didn't want any calls but this guy on the phone says he's a cop.
He says you're really gonna wanna know what he has to say.
I'm not too good on the phone.
I need to look people in the eye.
Well, what...
You can, um, you can crash on the couch.
It's comfortable.
Just have a seat.
Thanks.
So, how long do you think it's gonna take you?
Hm?
You told me you were looking for the guy who killed your wife.
Oh, it depends on if he's here in town or if he's moved on.
I have my file here.
Can I ask you something?
If you have all that information, why haven't the police found him for you?
They don't think he exists.
You see, I told them what I remembered.
I was asleep.
Something woke me up.
Her side of the bed was cold.
She'd obviously been gone for a while.
There had to be a second man.
Somebody hit me from behind.
I remember.
It's the last thing I do remember.
Look, the police didn't believe me.
If we check...
How did they explain what you do remember?
The gun and stuff?
John G was clever.
He was clever.
He took the dead man's gun and replaced it with the sap he hit me with.
He left my gun and the getaway car.
He gave the police a complete package.
They found the sap with my blood on it in the dead man's hand.
And they only found my gun.
They didn't need to look for anybody else.
I was the only guy who disagreed with the facts and I had brain damage.
The cops are not gonna believe someone in my condition.
Leonard.
You can stay here for a couple of days if it will help you.
Oh, thanks.
I have to go back to work, so, um, just make yourself at home.
You can watch TV or have some food.
Whatever you want, OK?
Make yourself at home.
One thing.
Natalie.
My, you really do have a problem.
Just like that cop said.
Well, nobody's perfect.
What's the last thing that you "do" remember?
Dying.
I remember my wife dying.
Let me, um, get you another one.
I think this one's dusty.
Why are you calling me?
What do you want?
I know you're a cop.
What do you want?
Have I done something wrong?
I don't know, something bad, maybe.
Look, why are you asking me?
I can't remember what I've done.
You wouldn't believe me anyway.
Because of my condition, you don't believe someone with this condition.
Nobody believed Sammy!
I didn't even fucking believe Sammy!
A beer, please.
You can't just waltz in here dressed like that and ask for a beer.
Yeah, we met before, right?
I don't remember.
I have no short-term memory.
Oh, you're that memory guy.
No.
He knows you.
He told me about you.
He said you were staying at the Discount.
In fact, a cop came by earlier and was looking for you.
Said he was looking for a guy who can't remember anything...
or what he'd done.
I get a lot of guys round here like that.
Chronic alcoholism is one cause of short-term memory loss.
What's happened to Jimmy?
You don't remember where you've been or what you've just done?
I can't make new memories.
Everything just fades.
Your pocket?
Bar bet.
Care to contribute?
Come on.
Proceeds are going to charity.
Help me out.
Thank you.
It's completely fucked because nobody believes you.
It's amazing what a little brain damage will do for your credibility.
I guess it's poetic justice for not believing Sammy.
You know the truth about my condition, officer?
You don't know anything.
You feel angry, you don't know why.
You feel guilty, you have no idea why.
You could do anything and not have the faintest idea ten minutes later.
Like Sammy.
What if I'd done something like Sammy?
I didn't tell you?
What happened to Sammy and his wife?
She came to see me at my office.
but I never said that he was faking.</i> not physical.</i> and gave Sammy his final exam.</i> Sammy?
It's time for my shot.
that he loved her,</i> Sammy?
It's time for my shot.
Hm.
the things she'd put him through.</i> Sammy?
It's time for my shot.
It won't hurt.
and never recovered.</i> or explain what happened.</i> Oh!
He's been in a home ever since.
He doesn't even know his wife is dead.
I was wrong about Sammy and I was wrong about his wife.
She wasn't interested in the money.
She needed to understand his problem.
but he wasn't a con man.</i> she thought he could be the same person.</i> I thought I saw recognition.</i> Now I know you fake it.
If you think you're supposed to recognise somebody, you pretend to.
from the doctors.</i> You bluff it to seem less of a freak.
What drug dealer?
The Jag's out front.
What are you still doing here, Lenny?
There's plenty of tattoo parlours up north.
I guess I wanted to get something down before it slipped my mind.
Give me a minute, I've got to get something for you.
Look, wait a minute, will ya?
Oh, man.
Come on, Leonard.
How many times I gotta tell you?
Because that cop's looking for you.
I gotta get you a new identity...
would do for now.
Put these on.
Whoa, whoa.
What cop?
He's a bad cop.
He's the one that checked you into the Discount Inn.
He's been calling you for days, slipping envelopes under your door, shit like that.
He knows you're no good on the phone so he's been calling you up.
Sometimes you don't answer the phone...
to scare you into answering it...
being a local drug dealer.
Jimmy Grants.
The cop wants to know how his operation is run.
He's got some score in mind.
I'm a snitch.
He's a cop from out of town.
The local boys put us together.
If he knew I was helping you, he'd fucking kill me.
So take these clothes, put them on and get the fuck out of here.
Come on, Leonard, just go.
You "are" full of shit.
Hey, Jimmy.
I'm sorry, I, uh, thought you were somebody else.
Sorry.
That's OK.
This Jimmy Grants deals drugs out of the bar where his girlfriend works?
But he's not going to bring her along?
He'll come by himself, right?
I always figured the drugs angle would be the best way to get him.
No, officer.
I'm as ready as I'll ever be.
You're in the lobby?
What do you look like?
I'll be right there.
Lenny!
Officer Gammell?
Yeah.
Come on.
Over here.
Is it Officer or Lieutenant Gammell?
You know what?
Don't write Gammell, just Teddy.
This is the directions, where he's going.
Nah, it wouldn't be appropriate.
Nice picture.
I look thin.
Hey, Lenny!
Make him beg.
Teddy!
Hey, Teddy!
Teddy!
Jimmy.
Expecting any other Jimmys, memory man?
Where the fuck's Teddy?
Well?
Motherfuck!
What are you doing?
Strip.
My associates are not the kind of people you wanna piss off.
Don't say anything else.
Your pants, too.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Wait, wait, wait!
Did he tell you what I was bringing?
Then, what?
Sammy.
How does he know about Sammy?</i> Oh, fuck.
Hey, mister!
I need help!
There's a guy in here, he's hurt bad.
We gotta get him to a doctor.
All right.
I don't know what happened.
I've got this memory thing.
I hope it's not as serious as his cos this guy's dead.
Who is that?
He knew me.
Of course he did, he raped your wife, he fucked up your brain.
Bullshit!
He's not the guy.
His name is James F Grants.
John G.
Check your tattoos.
Look, Jimmy's your guy.
I figured we'd make a few dollars on the side.
He dealt out of there.
The guy at the front desk let him know if anybody came round.
He called Jimmy the minute he saw you taking a picture.
He knew about Sammy, why would I tell him about Sammy?!
You tell everybody about Sammy!
Everybody who'll listen!
Great story.
Gets better every time you tell it.
So you lie to yourself to be happy.
There's nothing wrong with that.
We all do it.
Who cares if there's a few little details you'd rather not remember?
Your wife surviving the assault.
Her not believing your condition.
The torment and pain and anguish tearing her up inside.
The insulin.
That's Sammy, not me.
I told you about Sammy.
Yeah, right.
Like you tell yourself over and over again.
Condtitioning yourself to remember, learning through repetition.
Sammy let his wife kill herself.
Sammy ended up in an institution.
Sammy was a con man.
A faker.
I never said that Sammy was faking.
You exposed him for what he was.
A fraud.
I was wrong.
That's the whole point.
It was your wife who had diabetes.
Ouch!
My wife wasn't diabetic.
You sure?
Ouch!
Cut it out!
She wasn't diabetic.
You think I don't know my own wife?
What the fuck is wrong with you?
I guess I can only make you remember the things you want to be true.
He was to you.
Come on, you got your revenge.
Enjoy it while you still remember.
What difference does it make whether he was your guy or not?
When it's done, I will know.
I thought so, too, I was sure of it, but you didn't!
That's right.
The real John G.
I helped you find him over a year ago.
Look, Lenny...
to your wife's case, I believed you.
I thought you deserved a chance for revenge.
I'm the one that helped you find the other guy in your bathroom that night.
The guy that cracked your skull and fucked your wife.
We found him, you killed him.
But you didn't remember.
So I helped you start looking again, looking for the guy you already killed.
No reason, Lenny, no conspiracy, just bad fucking luck.
Couple of junkies too strung out to realise your wife didn't live alone.
But when you killed him I was so convinced that you'd remember.
But it didn't stick.
Like nothing ever sticks, like this won't stick.
I took that picture.
Just when you did it.
Look how happy you are.
I wanted to see that face again.
I gave you a reason to live and you were more than happy to help.
You don't want the truth.
You make up your own truth, like your police file.
It was complete when I gave it to you.
Who took out the twelve pages?
You, probably.
To create a puzzle you could never solve.
Do you know how many towns...
I mean, shit, Lenny, I'm a fucking John G.
My name's John Edward Gammell.
Cheer up.
There's plenty of John Gs for us to find.
All you do is moan!
I'm the one that has to live with what you've done.
I'm the one that put it all together.
You, you wander around, you're playing detective.
You're living a dream, kid.
A dead wife to pine for, a sense of purpose to your life...
even if I wasn't in the picture.
You're not a killer.
That's why you're so good at it.
Come on, what are you doing?
You know what time it is?
It's beer o'clock, I'm buying.
Fuck!
who wanted to make things right.</i> what you've told me?</i> what you made me do?</i> to solve?
Another John G to look for?</i> Hey!
Hey, that's not your car!
Somebody'll recognise it.
You know, I think I'd rather be mistaken for a dead guy than a killer.
I might hang on to this for a while.
Lenny.
Look, don't...
Will you help me find the keys?
Help me find my keys!
Lenny!
Lenny!
outside my own mind.</i> that my actions still have meaning.</i> are closed, the world's still here.</i> to remind ourselves who we are.</i> Dr.
Oppenheimer.
Dr.
Oppenheimer.
As we begin, I believe you have a statement to read into the record.
Yes, Your Honor.
We're not judges, Doctor.
No.
Of course.
Members of the security board.
The so-called and derogatory information in your indictment of me cannot be fairly understood, except in the context of my life and my work.
How long did he testify?
Honestly, I forget.
The whole hearing took a month.
An ordeal.
I've only read the transcripts, but...
Who'd want to justify their whole life?
Are they really going to ask about it?
It was years ago.
Oppenheimer still divides America.
The committee is gonna want to know where you stood.
Senator Thurmond asked me to say not to feel that you're on trial.
Aw.
Funny, I didn't till you just said that.
Really, Mr.
Strauss...
It's Admiral.
Admiral Strauss.
This is a formality.
President Eisenhower has asked you to be in his cabinet.
Senate really has no choice but to confirm you.
And if they bring up Oppenheimer?
When they bring up Oppenheimer, you answer honestly.
No senator can deny you did your duty.
It'll be uncomfortable.
Who'd want to justify their whole life?
Why did you leave the United States?
I, uh...
I wanted to study the new physics.
Was there nowhere here?
I thought Berkeley had the leading theoretical physics department.
Yes.
Once I had built it.
But first I had to go to Europe.
I went to Cambridge to study under Patrick Blackett.
Were you happier there than in America?
No.
No, I, uh...
I was homesick, um, emotionally immature, troubled by visions of a hidden universe.
Useless in the lab.
Christ, Oppenheimer.
Have you had any sleep?
Start again.
I need to go to the lecture, sir.
Why?
It's Niels Bohr.
I'd completely forgot.
All right.
Let's go.
Oh, no, not you, Oppenheimer.
You finish coating those plates.
Quantum physics is not a step forward.
It is a new way to understand reality.
Einstein's opened the door.
Now we are peering through, seeing a world inside our world.
A world of energy and paradox that not everyone can accept.
Yeah...
Are you all right?
Niels, meet J.
Robert Oppenheimer.
What's the J stand for?
Nothing, apparently.
You were at my lecture.
You asked the only good question.
No one's denying his insight.
It's his laboratory work that leaves a little to be desired.
I heard you give the same lectu...
At Harvard, yes, and you asked the same question.
Why ask again?
Hadn't liked your answer.
You can lift the stone without being ready for the snake that's revealed.
Now it seems you're ready.
But you don't enjoy the lab?
So get out of Cambridge with its beakers and potions.
Go somewhere they'll let you think.
Where?
Göttingen.
Get to Germany.
Study under Max Born.
Learn the ways of theory.
I'll send word.
Wormhole.
How's your mathematics?
Not good enough for the physicist he wants to be.
Algebra's like sheet music.
The important thing isn't It's "can you hear it?" Can you hear the music, Robert?
Yes, I can.
The senator from Wyoming.
Admiral Strauss, I'm interested in your relationship with Dr.
J.
Robert Oppenheimer.
You met him in 1947?
Correct.
You were commissioner of the Atomic Energy Commission?
I was, but I actually met Robert in my capacity as board member of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, because after the war he was world renowned as the great man of physics, and I was determined to get him to run the Institute.
Dr.
Oppenheimer.
An honor.
Mr.
Strauss.
It's pronounced "straws." Oh-ppenheimer, Oppenheimer.
Whatever way you say it, they know I'm Jewish.
I'm president of Temple Emanu-El in Manhattan.
the Southern pronunciation.
Anyway, welcome to the Institute.
I think you could be very happy here.
Yes, well, you'll love the commute.
The position comes with that house for you and your wife, and your...
Is it two children?
Yes, two.
I'm a great admirer of your work.
And you're a physicist by training, Mr.
Strauss?
I'm sorry, common room, four o'clock tea.
No, I'm not trained in physics or anything else.
I'm a self-made man.
Ah.
I can relate to that.
Really?
Yes, my father was one.
And this would be your office.
I'm told he's there most afternoons.
You know, I've always wondered why you didn't involve him in the Manhattan Project.
Greatest scientific mind of our time.
Of his time.
Einstein published his Theory of Relativity more than 40 years ago now.
But never embraced the quantum world it revealed.
Precisely.
You never thought of studying physics formally, Mr.
Strauss?
I had offers, but I chose to sell shoes.
Lewis Strauss was once a lowly shoe salesman.
No, just a shoe salesman.
I'd love to introduce you.
No need.
I have known him for years.
Albert.
What was that?
What did you say to him?
Oh, he's fine.
Mr.
Strauss, there are things in my past you ought to be aware of.
Well, as chairman of the AEC, I have access to your security file.
I've read it.
You're not worried?
No.
Why would I be worried after everything you've done for your country?
Well, times change, Mr.
Strauss.
Well, the purpose of this institute is to provide a haven for independent minds.
That's you.
You are the man for the job.
Well, then I'll consider it.
I'll see you at the AEC meeting tomorrow.
This is one of the most prestigious appointments in the country.
Yes, with a great commute.
That's why I'm considering it.
So, Dr.
Oppenheimer brought your attention to his past associations before you appointed him?
Just then I was entirely consumed with what he must have said to Einstein to sour him on me.
But later?
Well, we all know what happened later.
Doctor, your time in Europe, you seemed to meet with a wide range of other countries' physicists.
Yes, that's right.
Any Russians?
None that spring to mind.
If you'll just allow me to continue with my statement...
Mr.
Robb, you'll have ample opportunity to cross-examine.
After Göttingen, I moved on to Leiden in Holland, where I first met Isidor Rabi.
Excuse me.
A Yank, lecturing on the new physics?
This I have to hear.
I'm an American myself.
How surprising.
Let me know if you need any help with the English.
Wait, what's he saying?
No, thank you.
It's a long way to Zurich.
You get any skinnier, we're gonna lose you between the seat cushions.
I'm Rabi.
Oppenheimer.
I caught your lecture on molecules.
Caught some of it.
We're a couple of New York Jews.
How do you know Dutch?
Well, I thought I'd better learn it when I got here this semester.
You learned enough Dutch in six weeks to give a lecture on quantum mechanics?
Wanted to challenge myself.
Quantum physics wasn't challenging enough.
Schvitzer.
Schvitzer?
Show-off.
Dutch in six weeks, but you never learned Yiddish?
They don't speak it so much my side of the park.
Screw you.
Ever get the feeling our kind isn't entirely welcome here?
Physicists?
That's funny.
Not in the department.
They're all Jewish too.
Eat.
There's a German you have to seek out.
Heisenberg.
Right.
One might be led to the presumption that behind the quantum world, there still hides a real world in which causality holds, but such speculations seem to us, to say it explicitly, fruitless.
Thank you.
Have a great day.
Werner.
Wonderful.
Thank you.
Dr.
Oppenheimer.
Oppenheimer, yes.
I liked your paper on molecules.
Probably because you inspired it.
If I inspire anything else, let me know.
We could publish together.
I have to get back to America.
Why?
There's no one there taking quantum mechanics seriously.
That's exactly why.
He's pining for the canyons of Manhattan.
Canyons of New Mexico.
You're from New Mexico?
No.
New York, but my brother and I have a ranch outside Santa Fe.
That's the America I miss right now.
Then it's best you get home, cowboys.
That's him.
No, me and horses?
I don't think so.
Nice to meet you.
Did you ever encounter Heisenberg again?
Not in person, no, but, uh...
you might say our paths crossed.
On returning to America, I accepted positions at both Caltech and up at Berkeley.
Dr.
Lawrence, I presume?
I hear you want to start a school of quantum theory.
I am starting it.
Next door.
They put you in there?
I asked for it.
Wanted to be close to you experimentalists.
Theory will get you only so far, huh?
We're building a machine to accelerate electrons.
Magnificent.
Would you like to help?
Build it?
Oh, no.
No, no.
But I am working on theories I'd like to test with it.
When do you start teaching?
I've got my first in an hour.
One student?
That's it?
I'm teaching something no one here has dreamt of.
But once people start hearing what you can do with it...
There's no going back.
Nah...
Yeah.
Yes, this is it.
Please.
Take a seat.
What do you know about quantum mechanics?
I have a grasp on the basics.
Then you're doing it wrong.
Is light made up of particles or waves?
Quantum mechanics says it's both.
How could it be both?
But it is.
It's paradoxical, and yet, it works.
Now...
Thank you.
Mr.
Lomanitz.
You're gonna be okay.
Mr.
Snyder.
Now let's consider a star.
A star.
A vast furnace burning in outer space, fire pushing outwards against its own gravity.
Balanced.
But if that furnace cools and gravity starts winning, it contracts.
Density increases.
Correct.
Increasing gravity.
It's a vicious cycle until...
What's the limit here?
I don't know.
See where the math takes us.
I guarantee it's somewhere no one's been before.
Me?
Yes, you.
Your math is better than mine.
Dr.
Oppenheimer's file contained details of his activities in Berkeley.
Why would they have started a file on Dr.
Oppenheimer before the war?
Well, you'd have to ask Mr.
Hoover.
I'm asking you, Admiral Strauss.
Uh, my assumption is that it was connected to his, uh, left-wing political activities.
You shouldn't let them bring up politics in the classroom, Oppie.
I wrote that.
Lawrence, you embrace the revolution in physics.
Can't you see it everywhere else?
Picasso, Stravinsky, Freud, Marx.
Well, this is America, Oppie.
We had our revolution.
Seriously, keep it out of the lab.
Well, out of the lab, my landlady is having a discussion group tonight.
Interested?
I have sampled the Berkeley political scene.
It's all just philosophy postgrads and communists talking integration.
You don't care about integration?
I want to vote for it, not talk about it.
Especially on a Friday.
Come on.
Let's eat.
I'm meeting my brother there.
And how would these activities have come to the attention of the FBI?
Well, if I remember correctly, the FBI was taking license plates outside suspected communist gatherings, and his name popped up.
Jesus Christ.
Sorry.
Frank.
Robert.
Uh, you remember Jackie.
Evening.
Let's go.
Robert.
I want you to meet Chevalier.
Dr.
Haakon Chevalier, Dr.
Robert Oppenheimer.
Pleasure.
Pleasure.
This is my little brother, Frank.
Hello.
Hello, Still Jackie.
Chevalier, you're in languages?
And your reputation precedes you.
What have you heard?
That you're teaching a radical new approach to physics I have no chance of understanding, but I hadn't heard you're a Party member.
Frank and I are thinking of joining.
Just the other day, I was...
I support a range of causes.
The Spanish Civil War?
A democratic republic being overthrown by fascist thugs, who wouldn't?
Our government.
They think that socialism is a bigger threat than fascism.
Not for long.
Look at what the Nazis are doing to the Jews.
I send funds to colleagues in Germany to emigrate.
I have to do something.
My own work is so abstract.
What are you working on?
What happens to stars when they die.
Do stars die?
Well, if they do, they cool, then collapse.
In fact, the bigger the star, the more violent its demise.
Their gravity gets so concentrated, it swallows everything.
Everything, even light.
Can that really happen?
The math says it can.
If we can get published, then perhaps one day an astronomer finds one.
But right now, all I have is theory, which can't impact people's lives.
Well, if you're going to send money to Spain, do it through the Communist Party.
I'm Jean.
Robert.
Haakon Chevalier.
The union meeting at Serber's last month.
Right, right, yes.
Oh, thank you.
Robert here says he's not a communist.
Well, then he doesn't know enough about it.
I've read Das Kapital, all three volumes.
It's turgid stuff.
There's some thinking, "Ownership is theft." I'm sorry, I read it in the original German.
Well...
It's not about the book.
It's about the ideas.
And you sound uncommitted.
I'm committed to thinking freely about how to improve our world.
Why limit yourself to one dogma?
You're a physicist.
You pick and choose rules?
Or do you use the discipline to channel your energies into progress?
I like a little wiggle room.
Do you always toe the party line?
I like my wiggle room too.
What?
Wait, wait, wait.
For a physicist.
You only have a shelf full of Freud?
Well, actually, my background's more...
Jungian?
You know analysis?
When I was a postgrad at Cambridge, I had a little trouble.
I'll bite.
I tried to poison my tutor.
Did you hate him?
I liked him very much.
You just needed to get laid.
Took my analyst two years, and I don't think they ever put it that succinctly.
You have everyone convinced you're more complicated than you actually are.
We're all simple souls, I guess.
I'm not.
What's this?
Sanskrit.
You can read this?
I'm learning.
Read this.
Well, in this part, Vishnu reveals his multi-armed self...
No.
Read the words.
This'll do.
It'll break before dawn.
Air cools overnight.
Just before dawn, it breaks.
Come on.
Come on.
So...
I'm getting married.
To Jackie?
Yeah, to Jackie.
The waitress.
Oppie, you're right.
It's lettin' up.
I'm gonna go see if there's any stars.
All your talk about the common man, but Jackie's not good enough for you, hmm?
We join the Party, and you can't hide your disapproval, why?
Is that because that's supposed to be your thing?
I haven't joined the Party, Frank.
And I don't think she should have convinced you to either.
Half of the faculty is communist.
Not that half.
I'm your brother, Frank, and I want you to be cautious.
And I want to wring your neck.
I won't live my life afraid to make a mistake.
You're happy, I'm happy.
So then I'm happy you're happy that I'm happy.
I feel like I could see one of those dark stars that you're working on.
You can't.
That's the whole point.
Their gravity swallows light.
It's like a kind of hole in space.
Is Frank okay?
Yes.
He just has a shitty brother.
It is special here.
When I was a kid, I thought if I could find a way to combine physics and New Mexico, my life would be perfect.
Little remote for that.
Yes.
Let's get some sleep.
That mesa we saw today, one of my favorite places in the world.
Tomorrow we'll climb it.
What's it called?
Los Alamos.
I didn't expect to see you today.
Do I have to make an appointment?
Oppie!
Oppie!
What?
What is it?
They've done it.
They've done it.
Hahn and Strassmann in Germany.
They split the uranium nucleus.
How?
Bombarded it with neutrons.
It's a nuclear fission.
They did it, they split the atom.
It's not possible.
I'm gonna try to reproduce it.
See?
Can't be done.
Very elegant.
Quite clear.
There's just one problem.
Where?
Next door.
Alvarez did it.
But then look, these fission pulses, they're massive.
I've seen 30 of these in the past ten minutes.
Theory will take you only so far.
During the process, extra neutrons boil off, which could be used to split other uranium atoms.
Chain reaction.
You're thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
You, me and every other physicist around the world who's seen the news.
What?
What are we all thinking?
A bomb, Alvarez.
A bomb.
I told you, Robert, no more fucking flowers.
I don't understand what you want from me.
I don't want anything from you.
Well, you say that and then you call.
Well, don't answer.
I'll always answer.
Fine.
Just no more flowers.
You're not coming?
You have to know when you're beaten, Robert.
It's not that simple, Hoke.
Barbara, good to see you, and the illustrious Dr.
Oppenheimer.
I'm Eltenton.
Pleasure.
Please, please.
Might you say a word about organized labor on campuses, yes?
Coming through!
Coming through.
I work at Shell.
We've signed up chemists, we signed up engineers, so why not scientists in academia?
Oppie!
Oppie!
Oppie!
Oppie!
Oppie!
Oppie!
Teachers are unionized.
Lawrence, academics have rights too.
Look, it's not that.
I've got a group coming.
Oh.
I'll sit in.
Not this one.
Richard.
Dr.
Bush.
What brings you two up north?
Richard, you tell Ruth I'll be down to Pasadena Thursday.
Your paper on black holes is in!
Where's Hartland?
Get Hartland.
Get Hartland.
September 1st, 1939.
The world's gonna remember this day.
Oh, Hartland.
Our paper, it's in print.
We've been upstaged.
During the Battle of Britain, I found myself increasingly out of sympathy with the policy of neutrality that communists advocated.
But after Hitler invaded Russia and we became allies, these communist sympathies, did they return?
No.
I need to make clear that my changing views on Russia did not mean a sharp break from those who held different views.
For a year or two, and during a previous marriage, my wife Kitty had been a Communist Party member.
This way.
This is where I keep the good stuff.
I thought this was the Tolmans' house.
I live with them while I'm at Caltech.
So, you're a biologist.
Well, somehow I have graduated to housewife.
Can you explain quantum mechanics to me?
Seems baffling.
Yes, it is.
Well, this glass, this drink, this countertop, uh, our bodies, all of it.
It's mostly empty space.
Groupings of tiny energy waves bound together.
By what?
Forces of attraction strong enough to convince us that matter is solid, stop my body passing through yours.
You're married to Dr.
Harrison.
Not very.
There is someone that I feel...
Does she feel the same way?
Sometimes.
Not enough.
You know, I'm going to New Mexico.
To my ranch, with friends.
You should come.
I meant with your husband.
Yes, you did.
a bit of difference.
Why did you marry him?
I was lost and he was kind.
Lost?
Well, my previous husband had died, and at 28 I wasn't really ready to be a widow.
Who was your first husband?
Nobody.
But my second husband was Joe Dallet.
He was, um, from money, like me, but he was a union organizer in Youngstown, Ohio.
Fell hard.
How hard?
Hard enough to spend the next four years living off beans and pancakes, handing out the Daily Worker at factory gates.
By 36, I just told Joe I couldn't take it anymore.
Quit the Party.
A year later, I wanted him back.
Him, not the Daily Worker.
He said, "Swell, I'll meet you on my way to Spain." He went to fight for the Loyalists?
And then he went to the brigades and I waited, and...
Joe got himself killed first time he popped his head outta the trench.
Ideology got Joe killed.
For nothing.
Spanish Republic isn't nothing.
My husband offered both our futures to stop one fascist bullet from embedding itself in a mudbank.
That's the definition of nothing.
Seems a little reductive.
Pragmatic.
Now here I am.
Wherever the hell this is.
I didn't want you to hear it from anyone else.
Least you didn't bring me flowers.
We both know I'm not what you want, Jean.
Yeah, but it's a door closing.
No.
Not as far as I'm concerned, no.
You knocked her up.
Fast work.
Can't keep a good man down.
I meant her.
She knew what she wanted.
What about the husband?
We talked.
They're getting a divorce so we can get married before she starts showing.
How civilized.
You idiot.
This is your community.
You think the rules don't apply to the golden boy?
Brilliance makes up for a lot.
Don't alienate the only people in the world that understand what you do.
One day you might need them.
F-A-E-C-T!
F-A-E-C-T!
The Federation of Architects, Engineers, Chemists and Technicians.
What do any of you have in common with farm laborers and dock workers?
Plenty.
Everybody out.
Now!
Not you.
What are you doing?
It's a trade union.
Filled with communists.
So?
I haven't joined the Party.
They won't let me bring you onto the project because of this shit.
They won't even let me tell you what the project is.
Oh, I know what the project is.
Oh, really?
We've all heard about Einstein and Szilard's letter to Roosevelt warning him the Germans could make a bomb, and I know what it means for the Nazis to have a bomb.
And I don't?
It's not your people they're herding into camps.
It's mine.
You think that I tell them about your politics.
The next time you're coming home from a meeting, why don't you take a look in the rearview mirror?
Listen to the sounds on your phone line and stop being so goddamn naive.
Why would they care what I do?
Because you're not just self-important, you're actually important.
Okay.
I get it.
If you could just be a little more...
Pragmatic.
I'll talk to Lomanitz, I'll talk to the others.
You don't have to worry.
It's done, Lawrence.
Then welcome to the war.
I filled out my first security questionnaire and was informed that my involvement with left-wing groups would not prove a bar to my working on the atomic program.
Why were his communist associations not seen as a security risk during the war?
Senator, I can't possibly answer for security clearance granted years before I ever met the man.
Fine.
What about after?
After the war, Dr.
Oppenheimer was the most respected scientific voice in the world.
That's why I asked him to run the Institute.
That's why he advised the Atomic Energy Commission.
Simple as that.
What are they accusing me of?
I think they just wanna know what happened between 1947 and 1954 to change your mind on Oppenheimer's security clearance.
I didn't.
I was chair of the AEC, but it wasn't me that brought the charges against Robert.
Who did?
Some former staff member of the Joint Congressional Committee.
He was a rabid anti-communist named Borden.
He wrote to the FBI demanding they take action.
The FBI?
Why not go to the AEC direct?
Why get caught holding the knife yourself?
What did Borden have against Oppenheimer?
This was the McCarthy Era.
People hounded out of jobs for any hint of red.
And then, reading Oppenheimer's security file, his communist brother, sister-in-law, fiancée, best friend, wife.
That's before we even get to the Chevalier incident.
But how would Borden have access to Oppenheimer's security file?
Because somebody gave it to him.
Somebody who wanted Robert silenced.
Who?
Who knows?
Robert didn't take care not to upset the power brokers in Washington.
His opinions on the atom became definitive and he wasn't always patient with us mere mortals.
I came in for plenty of harsh treatment.
There was an AEC vote on the export of isotopes to Norway, and they drafted in Robert to make me look like a fool.
But, Dr.
Oppenheimer, we've already heard from Admiral Strauss that these isotopes could be useful to our enemies in the production of atomic weapons.
Congressmen, you could use a shovel in making atomic weapons.
In fact, you do.
You could use a bottle of beer in making atomic weapons.
In fact, you do.
I say isotopes are less useful than electronic components, but more useful than a sandwich.
Genius is no guarantee of wisdom.
How could this man who saw so much be so blind?
Kitty?
Kitty?
Kitty, the project...
I'm in.
I'm in.
Let's celebrate.
Shouldn't you go to him?
I have been going to him all fucking day.
Okay.
Here.
Come here, darling.
I don't know how to say this.
I-I'm ashamed to ask.
Anything.
No, for a while, Hoke.
A while.
Does Kitty know you're here?
Yes, of course she knows.
Of course she knows.
We're awful people.
Selfish, awful people.
Forget I asked.
Selfish, awful people, they don't know they're selfish and awful.
Sit, sit, sit.
Robert, you see beyond the world we live in.
There is a price to be paid for that.
Of course we'll help you.
Everything's changing, Robert.
Having a child was always going to change...
No, the world, it's pivoting in some new direction.
It's reforming.
This is your moment.
We're putting together a group to study feasibili...
anything.
You should.
Lawrence won't get this done.
Or Tolman, or Rabi.
You will.
Who are the uniforms?
I thought you might know.
Dr.
Oppenheimer.
I'm Colonel Groves.
This is Lieutenant Colonel Nichols.
Have that dry cleaned.
Well, if that's how you treat Lieutenant Colonel, I'd hate to see how you treat a humble physicist.
If I ever meet one, I'll let you know.
Ouch.
Theaters of combat all over the world, but I have to stay in Washington.
The brass likes it so much they made me take over the Manhattan Engineer District.
Which is?
Don't be a smart ass.
You know damn well what it is.
You and half of every physics department across the country.
That's problem number one.
I thought problem number one would be securing enough uranium ore.
Just broke ground at Oak Ridge, Tennessee.
Now I'm looking for a project director.
And my name came up?
Nope.
Even though you brought quantum physics to America.
You're a dilettante, a womanizer, a suspected communist...
I'm a New Deal Democrat.
I said "suspected." Unstable, theatrical, egotistical, neurotic...
Nothing good, no?
Not even, Well, brilliance is taken for granted in your circle, so no.
No, the only person who had anything good to say was Richard Tolman.
Tolman thinks you have integrity, but he also strikes me as a guy who knows more about science than people.
Yet here you are.
You don't take much on trust.
I don't take anything on trust.
Why don't you have a Nobel prize?
Perhaps I'll have the same luck.
A Nobel prize for making a bomb?
Alfred Nobel invented dynamite.
So how would you proceed?
You're talking about turning theory into a practical weapons system faster than the Nazis.
Who have a 12-month head start.
Our fast neutron research took six months.
The man they've undoubtedly put in charge will have made that leap instantly.
He has the most intuitive understanding of atomic structure I have ever seen.
Just like I know Walther Bothe, Von Weizsäcker, Diebner.
In a straight race, the Germans win.
We've got one hope.
Which is?
Anti-Semitism.
What?
Hitler called quantum physics Said it right to Einstein's face.
Our one hope is that Hitler is so, so blinded by hate that he's denied Heisenberg proper resources, because it'll take vast resources.
Our nation's best scientists, working together.
Right now, they're scattered.
Which gives us compartmentalization.
All minds have to see the whole task to contribute efficiently.
Poor security may cost us the race.
Inefficiency will.
The Germans know more than us anyway.
The Russians don't.
Remind me, who are we at war with?
Somebody with your past doesn't wanna be seen downplaying the importance of security from our communist allies.
Point taken.
But, no.
You don't get to say "no" to me.
It's my job to say "no" to you when you're wrong.
So you have the job now?
Uh, I'm considering it.
I'm starting to see where you got your reputation.
My favorite response?
a hamburger stand." I couldn't.
But I can run the Manhattan Project.
There's a way to balance these things.
Keep the Rad Lab here at Berkeley under Lawrence.
Met Lab in Chicago under Szilard.
Large scale refining, where did you say?
Tennessee.
And Hanford.
And Hanford.
All America's industrial might and scientific innovation, connected by rail.
Focused on one goal.
One point in space and time.
And it comes together here.
A secret laboratory.
In the middle of nowhere, secure, self-sufficient, equipment, housing, the works.
Keep everyone there until it's done.
If we don't let scientists bring their families, we'll never get the best.
You want security, build a town, build it fast.
Where?
Welcome to Los Alamos.
Now, there's a boys' school we'll have to commandeer and the local Indians come up here for burial rites.
But, apart from that, nothing.
Forty miles.
Any direction.
Enough to find the perfect spot.
Build him a town.
Fast.
Let's go recruit some scientists.
Why would I leave my family?
I told you, you can bring your family.
I'm not a soldier, Oppie.
A soldier?
He's a general.
I've got all the soldier I need.
What can I tell them?
Heisenberg, Diebner, Bothe, Bohr.
What do these men have in common?
The greatest minds on atomic theory.
Yes, and?
Uh...
As much as you like, until you feel my boot on your balls.
You know isotopes and you know explosives, better than anyone in the world.
But you can't tell us what you're doing.
I don't know.
The Nazis have them.
Niels Bohr's in Copenhagen.
Under Nazi occupation.
Did they stop printing newspapers in Princeton?
Why would we go to the middle of nowhere for who knows how long?
A year or two.
Or three.
General, could you give us a moment?
It's about unleashing the strong force before the Nazis do.
Oh, my God.
Niels won't work for the Nazis.
No, never.
But while they have him, we don't.
That's why I need you.
Why would you think I'd do that?
Why?
Why?
How about because this is the most important fucking thing to ever happen in the history of the world.
How about that?
Fuck.
They are not gonna let me onto this project.
And failing a security check is not gonna be good for a career, even after the war.
So you're a fellow traveler.
So what?
This is a national emergency.
I've got some skeletons, they put me in charge.
They need us.
Until they don't.
Is there any chance of getting Bohr out of Denmark?
Nah, no dice.
I checked with the British.
Until we get Allied boots back onto the continent, there's just no way.
Is he that important?
How many people do you know who've proved Einstein wrong?
You know, it really would be quicker to take a plane.
No, plane's too risky.
Country needs us.
The Harvard guys, they say the building's too small for the cyclotron.
Get them together with the architects.
When's this place supposed to open?
Two months.
Robert, you're the great improviser, but this...
you can't do in your head.
Four divisions.
Experimental, Theoretical, Metallurgical, Ordnance.
Who's running Theoretical?
I am.
That's what I was afraid of.
You're spread too thin.
So you take Theoretical.
I'm not coming here, Robert.
Why not?
You drop a bomb, and it falls on the just and the unjust.
I don't wish the culmination of three centuries of physics to be a weapon of mass destruction.
Izzy.
I don't know if we can be trusted with such a weapon.
But I know the Nazis can't.
We have no choice.
Then...
the second thing you'll have to do is appoint Hans Bethe to run the theoretical division.
Wait, what was the first?
Take off that ridiculous uniform.
You're a scientist.
Groves is insisting we join.
Tell Groves to go shit in his hat.
They need us for who we are.
So be yourself.
Only better.
This is the only key.
And Teller's already here.
Shall I just show him in?
No, let's wait for the others.
Let's get started.
Hello, Edward.
Yes.
Gentlemen, so, we will work here until the T-section at Los Alamos is finished.
Edward, can I please...
It is more important.
When I calculated the chain reaction, I found a rather troubling possibility.
No.
This can't be right.
Show me how you did your calculations.
Yes.
It's exponential.
No.
No, no, no.
No.
This is fantasy.
Teller's calculations can't be right.
Do them yourself while I go to Princeton.
What for?
To talk to Einstein.
There's not much common ground between you two.
That's why I should get his view.
Ah, Dr.
Oppenheimer.
Well, have you met Dr.
Gödel?
We walk here most days.
Trees are the most inspiring structures.
Albert, might I have a word?
Of course.
Excuse me, Kurt.
You know, some days, Kurt refuses to eat.
Even in Princeton.
He's convinced that the Nazis can poison his food.
Hmm?
Wha...
Whose...
Whose work is this?
Teller's.
What do you take it to mean?
Neutrons smash into nucleus, releasing neutrons to smash into other nuclei.
Criticality, a point of no return, massive explosive force.
But this time, the chain reaction doesn't stop.
It would ignite the atmosphere.
When we detonate an atomic device, we might start a chain reaction that...
destroys the world.
So here we are, hmm?
Lost in your quantum world of probabilities and needing certainty.
Can you run the calculations yourself?
About the only thing you and I have in common is a disdain for mathematics.
Who's working on this in Berkeley?
Hans Bethe.
Well, he'll get to the truth.
And if the truth is catastrophic?
Then you stop.
And you share your findings with the Nazis.
So neither side destroys the world.
Robert.
This is yours, not mine.
Teller's wrong.
He's wrong.
Shh, shh, shh...
When you know Teller's critical assumptions, the real picture emerges.
Bottom line?
The chances of an uncontrolled nuclear reaction are near zero.
Near zero.
Oppie, this is good news.
Mmm.
Can you run them again?
No, you'll get the same answer.
Till they actually detonate one of these things, the best assurance you're going to get is this.
Near zero.
Theory will take you only so far.
Mmm.
You want to adopt?
She's kidding.
We wanted to see you before we left.
For parts unknown.
You know who I ran into the other day?
Eltenton.
Huh.
The chemist from Shell?
The union guy?
Yeah.
The FAECT guy.
He was moaning about how we're handling the war.
How so?
Lack of cooperation with our allies.
Apparently our government's not sharing any research with the Russians.
Well, he said, "Most scientists think the policy is stupid." Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
He mentioned that if anyone had anything they wanted to pass on, going around official channels, that he could help.
That would be treason.
Yes, of course.
I just thought you should know.
The brat is down.
Where are the martinis?
Coming right up.
The conversation ended there.
Nothing in our long-standing friendship would have led me to believe that Chevalier was actually seeking information, and I am certain that he had no idea of the work in which I was engaged.
It has long been clear to me that I should have reported this incident at once.
The Oppenheimer situation highlights the tension between scientists and the security apparatus.
In hopes of learning how the nominee handled such issues during his time at the AEC, we'll have a scientist appearing before the committee.
Who are they bringing in?
They haven't said.
Mr.
Chairman, if I may, I'm nominated for commerce secretary.
Why seek the opinion of scientists?
This is a cabinet post, Admiral.
We seek a wide range of opinion.
Well, I'd like to know the name of the scientist testifying, I'd like the chance to cross-examine.
This is not a court.
Formality, huh?
No presidential Cabinet nominee has failed to be confirmed since 1925.
This is just how the game is played.
It's in the bag, Lewis.
So play nice.
They bring in a scientist, so what?
You don't know scientists like I do, Counselor.
They resent anyone who questions their judgment, especially if you're not one of them.
I was chair of the AEC.
I'm easy to blame for what happened to Robert.
We can't have the Senate thinking the scientific community doesn't support you, sir.
And embrace it.
and the US won." I-I don't think we need to go there.
Isn't there someone we can call who knows what really happened?
Find out if he was based in Chicago or Los Alamos during the war.
he worked under Szilard and Fermi, not the cult of Oppie at Los Alamos.
Robert built that damn place.
He was founder, mayor, sheriff, all rolled into one.
All it needs is a saloon.
Let's go and see.
There's no kitchen.
Really?
We'll fix that.
Barbed wire?
Guns?
Oppie.
We're at war, Hans.
Halifax, 1917.
A cargo ship carrying munitions explodes in the harbor.
A vast and sudden chemical reaction.
The biggest man-made explosion in history.
Now let's calculate how much more destructive it would have been if it were a nuclear, and not a chemical, reaction.
Expressing power in terms of tons of TNT.
But it will be thousands.
Well, then...
kilotons.
Using U-235, the bomb will need...
Ah...
Right, sorry.
Gadget will need a 33-pound sphere about this size.
Or using plutonium, the ten-pound sphere.
Here's the amount of uranium Oak Ridge refined all of last month.
And the Hanford plant made this much plutonium.
Now, if we can enrich these amounts, we need a way to detonate them.
Are we boring you, Edward?
A little bit, yes.
May I ask why?
We all entered this room knowing a fission bomb was possible.
Instead of uranium or plutonium, we use hydrogen.
Heavy hydrogen.
Deuterium.
You see?
We compact the atoms together under great pressure to induce a fusion reaction.
Then we'll get not kilotons, but megatons.
Okay, hang on, hang on.
So how do you generate enough force to fuse hydrogen atoms?
A small fission bomb.
Ah...
There we are!
Well, since we're going to need one anyway, can we get back to the business at hand?
The isotopes issue wasn't your most important policy disagreement with Dr.
Oppenheimer, it was the hydrogen bomb, wasn't it?
As colleagues, we agreed to disagree on a great many things, uh, and, well, one of them was the need for an H-bomb program, yes.
Thanks for convening on short notice.
I can't believe it.
Here we are.
Catch me up.
What do we know?
One of our B-29s over the North Pacific has detected radiation.
Do we have the filter paper?
Wishful thinking, I'm afraid.
Are those the long-range detection filter papers?
It's an atomic test.
The Russians have a bomb.
We're supposed to be years ahead of them, but some...
What were you guys doing at Los Alamos?
Wasn't security tight?
but I was there.
We can now consider the actual mechanics of detonation.
Any ideas?
I call this "shooting." We fire a chunk of fissionable material into a larger sphere with enough force to achieve criticality.
What do we think?
Anyone?
I've been thinking about implosion.
Explosives around the sphere blast inwards, crushing the material.
I'd like to investigate that idea.
I'll talk to Ordnance, get you blowing things up.
Meet the British contingent.
Dr.
Oppenheimer, Klaus Fuchs.
How long have you been British?
Since Hitler told me I wasn't German.
Aha.
Come, welcome to Los Alamos.
School's up and running.
Bar...
always running.
And I thought of a way to reduce support staff.
I've offered jobs to all the wives.
Admin, librarians, computation.
We cut down on staff, keep families together.
These are some of the brightest minds in our community.
And they're already security cleared.
I've informed General Groves you've been holding cross-divisional, open discussions on a nightly basis.
Shut them down.
Compartmentalization is the key to maintaining security...
It's only the top men.
Who presumably communicate with subordinates.
These men aren't stupid.
They can be discreet.
Once a week.
Top men only.
Nichols.
I still haven't heard that my security clearance has been approved.
Well, you should wait.
You are aware that the Nazis have a two-year head start?
Dr.
Oppenheimer, the fact that your security clearance is proving difficult to obtain is not my fault.
It's yours.
May not be your fault, but it's your problem.
Because I'm going.
And how many people were in these, uh, open discussions?
Too many.
Compartmentalization was supposed to be the protocol.
We were in a race against the Nazis.
Robert, they just fired a starting gun.
What's the nature of the device they detonated?
The data indicates it may have been a plutonium implosion device.
Like the one you built at Los Alamos.
The Russians have a bomb, Truman needs to know what's next.
What's next?
Arms talks.
What about the Super?
Does Truman even know about it?
Did we brief him on that?
Not specifically.
We still don't know if a hydrogen bomb's technically feasible.
My understanding is that Teller proposed it?
Yes.
At Los Alamos?
Teller's designs have always been wildly impractical.
You'd have to deliver by ox cart.
I'm sorry, Dr.
Lawrence.
Do you want to comment?
No.
Because if it can put us ahead again, the President of the United States needs to know about it.
And if the Russians know about it already from a spy at Los Alamos, then we've gotta get going.
There's no proof there was a spy at Los Alamos.
Robert.
They put it under the football stadium?
The field's not in use anymore.
Just as well.
Come stai?
Va bene?
I hear you got a little town.
Yes.
Come and see.
Who could think straight in a place like that?
Huh?
Everybody will go crazy.
Thank you for the vote of confidence, Szilard.
Do we really...
Do we really need that in the notes?
When are you going to try it out?
We did.
The first self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction.
Didn't Groves tell you?
No.
One at a time, please.
One at a time.
Dr.
Oppenheimer?
I tried Personnel.
They asked if I could type.
Can you?
Harvard forgot to teach that on the graduate chemistry course.
Condon, put Mrs.
Hornig here on the plutonium team.
What the hell were you doing in Chicago?
Visiting the Met?
Why?
Because we have every right...
You have just the rights that I give you.
No more, no less.
We are adults trying to run a project here.
This is ridiculous.
Tell him.
Compartmentalization is the protocol we agreed to.
Enough of this madhouse.
Nobody can work under these conditions.
You know what, Generalissimo?
I quit.
Thanks for nothing.
Better off without him.
Aren't you more concerned about his discretion out there?
We'll have him killed.
I was just kidding.
No, he hates me, not America.
You know, General, not everyone has levers to pull like mine.
I don't think I understand.
You didn't hire me despite my left-wing past, you hired me because of it.
So you could control me.
Well, I'm not that subtle.
I'm just a humble soldier.
You're neither humble, nor just a soldier.
Well, now we understand each other, perhaps you can get me my security clearance so I can perform this miracle for you.
General Groves, were you aware of Dr.
Oppenheimer's left-wing associations when you appointed him?
I was aware that there were suspicions about him.
I was aware he had a very extreme, liberal background.
In your opinion, would he ever consciously commit a disloyal act?
I would be amazed if he did.
So you had complete confidence in his integrity?
At Los Alamos, yes, which is where I really knew him.
General, did your security officers on the project advise you against the clearance of Dr.
Oppenheimer?
They could not and would not clear him until I insisted.
And it's safe to say that you had a pretty good knowledge of Dr.
Oppenheimer's security file.
I did.
There's only really one question I need answered here today.
In light of the current AEC guidelines, would you clear Dr.
Oppenheimer today?
Do you have the guidelines?
Under current AEC guidelines, would you clear Dr.
Oppenheimer today?
Physics and New Mexico, huh?
My God.
What a trek.
That's why you need a liaison.
I'm appointing Lomanitz.
You're gonna be okay.
This way, gentlemen.
I'd like to remind you what we talked about in Berkeley.
Compartmentalization.
I understand completely.
Thank you.
Greetings from Berkeley.
I am here to update you on our progress and solicit your input.
To do so, I am going to have to share a few things that General Groves told me not to.
Sorry, General, I said I understood, not that I agreed.
Okay.
Gentlemen, to business.
There were rumors of espionage at Los Alamos.
Unsubstantiated.
I'm told that there were communists on the project.
We didn't knowingly employ any communists.
Were any of them involved in discussions of the Super?
I seem to remember you demanding your brother come to Los Alamos.
My brother had left the Party by then.
What about Lomanitz?
Lomanitz was never employed at Los Alamos.
He was a liaison.
Our security was tight, as former Colonel Nichols well knows.
Our security was as tight as it could be given the personalities involved, but attempts were made.
Do we need to talk about Jean Tatlock?
Or the Chevalier incident?
Excuse me.
That's Lomanitz, on line one.
Hello, Rossi.
What?
Okay, just calm down.
There's been another screw-up.
Lomanitz just got drafted.
We need this kid.
Fix it, will you?
It wasn't a mistake.
Your friend Lomanitz has been trying to unionize the Radiation Lab.
He promised to quit all that.
Well, he hasn't.
Security officer at Berkeley's concerned about communist infiltration through that union, the FA...
FAECT.
Well, I'm there next week, I'll...
drop in to see him.
Your Q clearance came through.
It's important you not maintain or renew any questionable associations.
Doctor, did you think social contacts between a person engaged on secret war work and communists was dangerous?
My awareness of the danger would be greater today.
I mean, it's fair to say that during the war years, you felt that such contacts were potentially dangerous?
Were conceivably dangerous, yes.
I mean, really?
Known communists?
Look...
I've had a lot of secrets in my head for a long time.
Doesn't matter who I associate with.
I don't talk about those secrets.
You said in your statement that you had to see Jean Tatlock in 1943.
You left.
Not a word.
What did you think that would do to me?
I wrote.
Pages of nothing.
Where did you go?
I can't tell you.
Why not?
Because you're a communist.
Why did you have to see her?
Because she had indicated a great desire to see me before we left.
At that time, I couldn't, but I felt that she had to see me.
She was undergoing psychiatric treatment.
She was extremely unhappy.
Did you find out why she had to see you?
Because she was still in love with me.
Spent the night together, didn't you?
Yes.
You drop in and out of my life and you don't have to tell me why.
Now, that's power.
Not that I enjoy.
I'd rather be here for you as you need.
But you have other priorities now.
I have a wife and child.
That's not what either of us is talking about.
Jean.
You asked me to come.
And I'm glad I did.
But I can't see you again.
But what if I need you?
You said you would always answer.
Not a word.
Did you think that consistent with good security?
As a matter of fact, it was.
Not a word.
When did you see her after that?
I never saw her again.
I can make the last train back to Princeton.
Kitty, I didn't say anything that I hadn't already told you.
Today you said it to history, didn't you?
This is a closed hearing.
If they don't release the transcript, I'm sure you will.
I was under oath.
Well, you were under an oath to me when you went to see Jean.
You know, you...
you sit there, day after day, letting them pick our lives to pieces.
Why won't you fight?
Robert, I'm not putting her up there.
Dr.
Oppenheimer, it's an honor.
Please, take a seat.
No need, I just wanted to check whether I should talk to Lomanitz while I'm here, given your concerns.
Well, I'd say that's really up to you, Professor, but I'd be cautious.
Uh-huh.
Understood.
Oh, and, um...
I wanted to give you a heads-up on a man named Eltenton.
Just that he might merit watching, is all.
I'd love to get more details.
Well, I have an appointment now, and I leave early tomorrow.
Well, come back as early as you like.
Since you haven't time now.
You went back the next morning.
I did.
I had to, really.
This time there was another man.
He said his name was Pash.
Pash.
You met Colonel Pash?
Colonel Pash, could you please read from your memo dated June 29, 1943?
conducted on subject indicate further possible Communist Party connections.
Subject met with, and spent considerable time with, one Jean Tatlock, communist, the record of whom is attached." Whom you had not met?
Not then, but soon after.
He's the head of security for the project.
Shouldn't I know him?
No, he should know you.
I would never put you in a room with Pash.
Why not?
When Pash first heard about Lomanitz, he told the FBI he was gonna kidnap him, take him out on a boat and interrogate him in the Russian manner.
General Groves has placed in me a certain responsibility, and it's like having a child who I can't see.
By remote control.
So to actually meet you is...
Whatever time you choose.
Mr.
Johnson told me of a conversation you had yesterday in which I'm very interested.
It's had me worried all day.
Yes, well, I didn't want to talk to Lomanitz without authorization.
That's not the particular interest that I have.
It's something a little bit more...
in my opinion, more serious.
Now, when the FBI pointed out that such information wouldn't be admissible in court, Pash made it clear he had no intention of leaving any witness left to prosecute.
Now, the FBI talked him down, but that's the man you're dancing with.
I gather you've heard there are other parties interested in the work of the Radiation Lab?
A man attached to the Soviet Consul indicated through intermediate people to people on this project that he was in a position to transmit information.
Why would anyone on the project wanna do that?
Frankly, I can see that there might be an argument for the commander-in-chief informing the Russians.
They're our allies after all.
But I don't like the idea of it going out the back door.
It might not hurt to be on the lookout for it.
And you said that to Pash?
I was trying to put it in the context of "Russia's not Germany." Boris Pash is the son of a Russian Orthodox bishop.
Born here, but in 1918, he went back to Russia to fight the Bolsheviks.
This is a man who has killed communists with his own hands.
I'm not the judge of who should or should not have information.
It's my business to stop it from going through illegally.
Would you be a little more specific?
There's a man whose name was mentioned to me a couple of times.
Eltenton.
Uh, I believe he's a chemist who works at Shell.
He talked to a friend of his who's an acquaintance of someone on the project.
And you thought Pash would be satisfied with that?
I was attempting to give them Eltenton without opening a can of worms.
I told them a cock-and-bull story.
Did you lie to General Groves too?
No.
I admitted to him that I'd lied to Pash.
Do you recall this conversation about the Chevalier incident?
I've seen so many versions of it, I wasn't confused before but I'm certainly getting there now.
What was your conclusion?
That he was under the influence of the typical American schoolboy attitude that there's something wicked about telling on a friend.
Well, now...
Might we know through whom the contact was made?
That would involve people who are not to be involved in this.
Is that someone a member of the project?
So Eltenton made his approach through a member of the faculty here at Berkeley?
As far as I know...
As far as I know, yes.
But...
more than one person involved.
Gentlemen, if I...
If I seem uncooperative, I think you can understand it's because of my insistence in not getting innocent people into trouble.
You're trying to protect your friend.
Who's protecting you?
If you order me to, I'll do it.
That is a mistake, Robert.
You need to volunteer this name.
But not then, did he?
No.
No.
In fact, it was some months later, wasn't it?
It was.
You are persistent, but that is your job.
And-And my job is to protect the people that work for me.
Instead of us going on certain steps, which may come to your attention...
and be disturbing to you, I would like to discuss those with you first.
I'm not formulating a plan.
I'll just have to digest the whole thing.
In the months in between your interview with Dr.
Oppenheimer and his eventual naming of Chevalier, did you expend resources trying to find the name of the intermediary?
Considerable resources, yes.
Without the name, our job was extremely difficult.
And when did you receive the name?
I was gone by the time Oppenheimer finally offered it up.
determining the status of the Nazi bomb project.
Who did?
General Groves.
He transferred me to London.
It's a little early for a Christmas party.
Something's up.
Tolman's been away.
Where?
Ruth won't tell.
Hey!
Come on, Ruthie.
Can't tell me, who can you tell?
Compartmentalization, Oppie.
What makes you think I know where he is anyway?
a pretty good job of knowing where Mr.
Tolman is when it counts.
Like now?
Attention!
Early Christmas present for you all.
The British pilots put me in the bomb bay.
Showed me the-the oxygen, you know, but I messed it up.
When they opened me up in Scotland, I was unconscious.
But I pretended I'd been napping.
Please enjoy your party.
Is it big enough?
To end the war?
To end all war.
Heisenberg sought me out in Copenhagen.
It was chilling, my old student working for the Nazis.
He told me some things to draw me out.
Sustained fission reactions in uranium.
That sounds more like a reactor than a bomb.
Did he mention gaseous diffusion?
He seemed more focused on heavy water.
As a moderator?
Yes, instead of graphite.
What?
He took a wrong turn.
We're ahead.
And with you here to help us, Niels...
Sorry, could you...
could you give us a moment, gentlemen?
I am not here to help, Robert.
I knew you could do this without me.
Then why did you come?
To talk about after.
The power you're about to reveal will forever outlive the Nazis.
And the world is not prepared.
ready for the snake that's revealed." We have to make the politicians understand, this isn't a new weapon.
It's a new world.
I'll be out there doing what I can, but you...
You are an American Prometheus.
The man who gave them the power to destroy themselves, and they'll respect that.
Then your work really begins.
I'm sorry, Oppie, but there's a call.
From San Francisco.
Robert?
Robert?
Robert.
Robert.
Oh, my God.
What's the matter?
What happened?
Her father called.
They found her yesterday in the bath.
Who?
She'd taken pills.
Left a note, not signed.
She took barbiturates, but there was chloral hydrate in her blood.
There was a note.
Jean Tatlock?
We were together.
She said she needed me.
I...
I told her I...
I told her I couldn't...
No, it was...
it was me...
You don't get to commit the sin and then have us all feel sorry for you that it had consequences.
You pull yourself together.
You know, people here depend on you.
Donald, would you like to contribute here, please?
You're on your own, pal.
Bob, I'm not quitting my job because plutonium is radioactive.
We just don't know what it might do to the female reproductive system...
Your reproductive system is more exposed than mine, presumably.
Can we please?
The implosion device is nowhere.
You can't rush everything.
Oppie, please.
Well, there's rushing and there's getting on with it, so, pick one.
Wait.
Neddermeyer's doing his job.
Teller's not helping.
You're not helping.
I've been asking for calculations on the implosion lenses for weeks.
On a hydrogen bomb we're not even building.
I won't work for that man.
Let him go.
He's a prima Donna.
I agree.
He should leave Los Alamos.
Okay.
Kisty, you replace Neddermeyer.
Seth, I'm putting you on plutonium.
Lilli, you go work for Kisty, because he needs you.
Fuchs, you take Teller's role.
I'm putting you exclusively on the implosion device.
And no one is leaving Los Alamos.
They won't let me leave.
No.
I won't let you leave.
Forget Hans.
Forget fission.
Stay here, research what you want.
Fusion, the hydrogen bomb, whatever.
We'll meet to discuss.
You don't have time to meet.
You're a politician now, Robert.
You've left physics behind many, many years ago.
Once a week.
One hour, you and me.
Now raise this fucking barrier.
So the Super was under development on your watch at Los Alamos?
Yes.
And yet, after the war, you tried to deny it was viable.
No, no, no.
I-I pointed out technical difficulties with it.
Didn't you try to kill it at the AEC meeting But that was the recommendation of the AEC, was it not?
After hours of discussion about the best response.
An H-bomb is 1,000 times the power of an A-bomb.
Its only intended target would be the largest cities.
It's a weapon of mass genocide.
Izzy, draw some circles on this side of the map where they would target us.
Starting with New York.
It's a weapon of attack with no defensive value.
Do we really need more deterrence than our current arsenal of atomic bombs?
Y-You drown in ten feet of water or 10,000, what's the difference?
We can already drown Russia.
They know it.
Robert?
Robert.
As I said, Teller's designs are still as impractical as they were during the war.
A hydrogen bomb can be made to work, Oppie, you know that.
I don't believe we should commit all our resources to that chance.
Then how would you have Truman reassure the American people?
Simply by limiting the spread of atomic weapons through international control on nuclear energy.
By which you mean world government.
The United Nations, as Roosevelt intended.
Well, I asked what Truman should do, right?
The world's changed.
It's not fascism but communism that now threatens our survival.
Lewis, do you understand, if we build a hydrogen bomb, the Russians will have no choice but to build their own?
Could they be working on one already, based on information gathered from a spy at Los Alamos?
No spy at Los Alamos.
Gentlemen.
Let's not get sidetracked.
There wasn't?
I say we use this moment to gain concessions from the Russians by committing that we will not build a hydrogen bomb.
Thereby revealing its existence.
Which you seem convinced they already know.
All right.
At this point, I'd like the committee members to meet in privacy to finalize our recommendations.
I'm just not sure you wanna go down this road.
Lewis, with respect, we are the advisory committee, we will give them our advice.
Dr.
Oppenheimer?
Hi.
William Borden.
Joint Committee on Atomic Energy?
Oh, yes, yes.
During the war, I was a pilot.
One night, flying back from a raid, I saw an amazing sight, like a meteor.
A V-2 rocket headed to England.
I can't help but imagine what it will be for such an enemy rocket to carry an atomic warhead.
Well, let's make sure we're not the ones to make that possible.
Oppie, I don't think you wanna go up against Strauss.
If we both speak, they listen to me.
When you speak, they hear a prophet.
When Strauss speaks, they hear themselves.
They'll listen to a prophet.
A prophet can't be wrong.
Not once.
Didn't you accuse Oppenheimer of sabotaging the development of the Super?
I was never one of those to bandy around terms like "sabotage." But Mr.
Borden was?
As I understand it, possibly.
How was Mr.
Borden able to put together such a detailed indictment?
He was no longer a government employee, yet he appears to have had unlimited access to Dr.
Oppenheimer's file.
Might Mr.
Nichols have given him access to the file?
Or someone else at the AEC?
That's a very serious accusation, Senator.
Is it your intention to suggest that Dr.
Oppenheimer is disloyal to the United States?
I've always assumed, and still assume, that he's loyal to the United States.
I believe this.
And I shall believe it until I see very conclusive proof to the opposite.
Do you, or do you not believe that Dr.
Oppenheimer is a security risk?
And if I may, when Hitler blew his brains out in that bunker, it is my humble opinion that there is no need for that bomb to be seen anywhere except for that test site.
We at least have to take a moment to think about whether the means justify the ends any longer, because...
Germany is about to surrender.
It's no longer the enemy who are the greatest threat to mankind.
It's our work.
Hitler is dead, it's true.
But the Japanese fight on.
Their defeat seems assured.
Not if you're a GI preparing to invade.
We can end this war.
But how do we justify using this weapon on human beings?
We're theorists, yes?
We imagine a future, and our imaginings horrify us.
But they won't fear it until they understand it, and they won't understand it until they've used it.
When the world learns the terrible secret of Los Alamos, our work here will ensure a peace mankind has never seen.
A peace based on the kind of international cooperation that Roosevelt always envisaged.
Well, hard to put a price on it.
Not really.
Just add up the bills.
babies delivered the first year.
This year we've had ten a month.
Birth control is a little out of my jurisdiction, General.
Kiddo.
Head down, every...
Fuchs.
Head down.
That's the one.
Two viable bombs.
I need a date.
September.
July.
That's the sweet spot, gentlemen.
August.
July.
Test in July.
But I need my brother.
Frank knows the desert, he's left politics behind, he's been working with Lawrence for two years now.
What do we call the test?
three person'd God." What?
Trinity.
You insisted on bringing on your brother Frank, a known communist.
Former communist.
You brought a known former communist onto America's most secret and important defense project.
I knew my brother could be trusted.
Absolutely.
And you felt your judgment was sound on who on the team could be trusted.
Fuchs, head down.
Okay, everybody ready.
I hope you learned something.
Yeah, we learned we're gonna need to be a lot further away.
Well, figure it out.
Fast.
We leave for Washington in the morning.
We're gonna give them a date.
You're a long way from Chicago, Leo.
If we don't act now, they're going to use this thing against Japan.
We booked a meeting with Truman, but somebody killed it.
You're meeting the secretary of war.
Just because we're building it doesn't mean we get to decide how it's used.
History will judge us, Robert.
In Chicago, we put together a petition.
I'm not getting into that.
Just tell me your concerns and I'll relay them.
My concerns?
Germany's defeated.
Japan's not going to hold out alone.
How could you know that?
You got us into this.
You and Einstein with your letter to Roosevelt saying we could build a bomb.
Against Germany.
That's not how weapons manufacture works, Szilard.
Oppie, you have to help.
Fermi's in the meeting.
Lawrence is in the meeting.
They're not you.
You're the great salesman of science.
You can convince anyone of anything.
Even yourself.
Excuse me.
The firestorm in Tokyo killed 100,000 people.
Mostly civilians.
I worry about an America where we do these things and no one protests.
Pearl Harbor and three years of brutal conflict in the Pacific bought us a lot of latitude with the American public.
Enough to unleash the atomic bomb?
The A-bomb might not cause as much damage as the Tokyo bombings.
What are we estimating?
In a medium-sized city, Yes, but don't underestimate the psychological impact of an atomic explosion.
A pillar of fire Deadly neutron effects for a mile.
In all directions.
From one single device.
Dropped from a barely noticed B-29, the atomic bomb will be a terrible revelation of divine power.
If that's true, it would be definitive.
World War II would be over.
Our boys would come home.
Military targets?
Uh...
There aren't any big enough.
Perhaps a vital war plant with workers housed nearby?
And we could issue a warning to reduce civilian casualties.
They'd send everything they have up against us, and I'd be up in that plane.
But if we announce it and it fails to go off, we'd scupper any chance of a Japanese surrender.
Is there no way to demonstrate a bomb to Japan to provoke surrender?
We intend to demonstrate it in the most unambiguous terms.
Twice.
Once, to show the weapon's power, and a second to show that we can keep doing this until they surrender.
We have a list of 12 cities to choose from...
Sorry, 11.
I've taken Kyoto off the list due to its cultural significance to the Japanese people.
Also, my wife and I honeymooned there.
It's a magnificent city.
Let me make this simple for you, gentlemen.
According to my intelligence, which I cannot share with you, the Japanese people will not surrender, under any circumstances, short of a successful and total invasion of the home islands.
Many lives will be lost, American and Japanese.
The use of the atomic bomb on Japanese cities will save lives.
Well, if we use this weapon without informing our allies, they'll see it as a threat, and we'll be in an arms race.
How open can we be with the Soviets?
Secrecy won't stop the Soviets from becoming part of the atomic world.
We've been told they have no uranium.
You've been misinformed.
A Russian bomb is a matter of time.
The program needs to continue at full pace after the war.
Secretary Stimson, if I may, not all scientists on the project are in agreement.
In fact, this might be a moment to consider other opinions.
If you talk...
The Manhattan Project has been plagued from the start by certain scientists of doubtful discretion and uncertain loyalty.
One of them just tried to meet with the president.
Now, we need these men, but as soon as it's practical, we should sever any such scientists from the program.
Wouldn't you agree, Doctor?
If a Russian bomb is inevitable, perhaps we should invite their top scientists to Trinity?
President Truman has no intention of raising expectations that Stalin be included in the atomic project.
Informing him of our breakthrough and presenting it as a means to win the war need not make unkeepable promises.
But the Potsdam peace conference in July will be President Truman's last chance to have that conversation.
Can you give us a working bomb by then?
Absolutely.
We will test fire before the conference.
Ground Zero, observation posts at Where do we trigger from?
South, 10,000.
And Base Camp is ten miles south here.
And there's a further observation post on...
on that hill 20 miles away.
What's that, Frank?
Trigger lines already went in.
The Air Force requested a line of lights for their B-29.
What B-29?
Our bomb's on the tower.
They wanna use the test to confirm a safe operating distance.
and hoping that we were right about the blast radius.
Don't let them slow us down.
We're firing on the 15th.
The 15th?
That's not...
The 15th.
The 15th.
So I'll be here at South Observation point with Frank and Kistiakowsky.
You'll all be assigned to Base Camp, West Observation, or Far Observation.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Careful with the knife.
There, carefully.
Time to stand behind your science, Hans.
Literally.
Yeah.
What about the radiation cloud?
Without high winds, it should settle within two to three miles.
Evacuation measures are in place.
But we need good weather for visibility, so it has to be fine.
Everybody out.
We go on the night of the 15th.
It's a hard deadline, so if anyone has anything, speak now.
Little, little more.
Okay, stop, stop.
Everybody, mattresses.
Put the mattress underneath.
Could use a final implosion test.
Is there anything else that might stop us?
It's happening, isn't it?
I'll send a message.
If it's gone our way...
take in the sheets.
Robert.
Break a leg.
Okay.
Oppie's taken a very modest three kilotons.
And does anyone want the side action on atmospheric ignition?
This weather, has it reached the site?
Bethe is calling to tell you the implosion test failed.
Hello, Hans.
Yes, he's here.
Yes.
I know the implosion lenses will work.
If we fire these detonators and they don't trigger a reaction, two years' worth of plutonium will be scattered across White Sands.
A month of my salary against ten bucks says it lights.
Jesus.
The wind's picking up at Zero, not the rain.
Lightning circling.
You think it might be time to tell your men to get away from the steel tower with the atomic bomb?
We can make our determination there.
The team hasn't slept in two nights.
If we stand down, make the bomb safe, we won't be back here for weeks.
Then we'll miss Potsdam.
I gotta get word to Truman by 7:00.
Our window's closing.
What is this doing?
Raining, blowing, lightning.
It'll break before dawn.
How could you know that?
I know this desert.
Storm cools overnight.
Just before dawn, the storm breaks.
He could be right, but schedule as late as possible.
Sign your forecast.
If you're wrong, I'll hang you.
Three years, two billion dollars.
Well, if it doesn't go off, we're both finished.
I'm betting on three kilotons.
Anything less, they won't get what it is.
What did Fermi mean by "atmospheric ignition"?
Well, we had a moment where it looked like the chain reaction from an atomic device might never stop.
Setting fire to the atmosphere.
Why is Fermi still taking side bets on it?
Call it gallows humor.
Wait, are we saying there's a chance that when we push that button, we destroy the world?
Nothing in our research over three years supports that conclusion.
Except as the most remote possibility.
Near zero.
What do you want from theory alone?
Zero would be nice.
In exactly one hour, It's letting up.
The arming party's left Zero, they're heading this way.
Throwing the switches.
Turn the cars.
Ready for emergency evacuation.
Take your welder's glass.
Everybody, take your places.
Everybody take a welder's glass!
Everybody take a welder's glass.
Twenty minutes.
Twenty minutes.
That's 20.
On the leg, please.
Feynman.
No.
For your eyes, sir.
The glass stops the UV.
And what stops the glass?
I'm gonna head to Base Camp.
Best of luck.
Robert, try not to blow up the world.
Watch that needle.
If the detonators don't charge, or the voltage drops below one volt, you hit that button, you abort.
Understood?
Understood.
Two minutes to detonation.
Everybody down.
Do not turn around until you see light reflected on the hills.
Then look at the explosion only through your welder's glass.
Ninety seconds to detonation.
Eighty seconds to detonation.
Is it rubbed in?
Yeah.
Sixty seconds to detonation.
These things are hard on your heart.
Thirty seconds.
Detonator's charged.
Ten...
eight...
seven...
six...
five...
four...
three...
two...
one.
It worked.
You owe me ten dollars!
Oh!
Come on!
I...
I'm good for it, Kisty.
You are.
Yes, you are!
We did it!
Well done.
Get me Potsdam right away.
Get a message to Kitty.
We can't say anything.
Tell her to take in the sheets.
Shh.
What...
What?
Charlotte.
Charlotte, go ahead, go ahead.
Oh, um, well, I don't know, he just said to tell you to "bring in the sheets." Kitty?
Kitty?
Kitty, are you still there?
If they detonate it too high in the air, the blast won't be as powerful.
With respect, Dr.
Oppenheimer, we'll take it from here.
Did Truman brief Stalin at Potsdam?
A brief would be an overstatement.
He referred to a powerful new weapon.
Stalin hoped we'd use it against Japan.
That's it?
Robert, we've given them an ace, it's for them to play the hand.
You're aiming for the 6th?
Well, it's up to the CO in the Pacific.
Should I come with you to Washington?
What for?
Well, you'll keep me informed.
Of course.
As best I can.
Would the Japanese surrender if they knew what was coming?
I don't know.
Have you seen Szilard's petition?
What the hell does Szilard know about the Japanese?
You're not signing it, are you?
Many people have.
A lot of people have.
Edward, the fact that we built this bomb does not give us any more right or responsibility to decide how it's used than anyone else.
But we're the only people who know about it.
I've told Stimson the various opinions of the community.
But what's your opinion?
Once it's used...
nuclear war, perhaps all war...
becomes unthinkable.
Until somebody builds a bigger bomb.
I thought they would call.
It's only the 5th.
In Japan, it's the 6th.
Charlotte.
Try Groves.
Anything?
Charlotte?
Truman's on the radio.
Sixteen hours ago, an American airplane dropped one bomb on Hiroshima...
its usefulness to the enemy.
The bomb had more power than 20,000 tons of TNT.
It is an atomic bomb.
It is a harnessing of the basic power of the universe.
Groves on one.
We are now prepared to destroy, more rapidly and completely, the Japanese...
General?
I'm very proud of you and all of your people.
It went all right?
Apparently, it went with a tremendous bang.
Well, everyone here is feeling reasonably good about it.
It's been a long road.
I think one of the wisest things I ever did was when I selected the director of Los Alamos.
We have spent more than two billion dollars on the greatest scientific gamble in history, and we have won.
Oppie!
Oppie!
Oppie!
Oppie!
Oppie!
Oppie!
Oppie!
Oppie!
The world...
will remember this day.
It's too soon to...
It's too soon to determine what the results of the bombing are.
But I'll bet the Japanese didn't like it.
I'm so proud.
So proud of what you have accomplished.
I just wish we had it in time to use against the Germans.
Dr.
Oppenheimer?
Dr.
Oppenheimer?
Nice picture.
President Truman will see you now.
Dr.
Oppenheimer.
It's an honor.
Mr.
President.
Please.
Thank you.
Secretary Byrnes.
How's it feel to be the most famous man in the world?
You helped save a lot of American lives.
What we did at Hiroshima was a...
And Nagasaki.
Well, obviously.
Your invention let us bring our boys home.
Well, it was hardly...
my invention.
It was you on the cover of Time.
Jim tells me you're concerned about an arms race with the Soviets.
Oh, yes, uh...
Well, um...
It's that, uh, now is our chance to secure...
international cooperation on...
a-a-and I'm concerned...
Do you know when the Soviets are gonna have the bomb?
I don't think I could give a precise...
Never.
Never.
Mr.
President, the Russians have good physicists a-a-and abundant resources.
Abundant?
Yes.
I don't think so.
Well, they'll put everything they have in...
I hear you're leaving Los Alamos.
What should we do with it?
Give it back to the Indians.
Um, Dr.
Oppenheimer, if what you say about the Soviets is true, we have to build up Los Alamos, not shut it down.
Mr.
President...
Um...
I feel that I have blood on my hands.
You think anyone in Hiroshima or Nagasaki gives a shit who built the bomb?
They care who dropped it.
I did.
Hiroshima isn't about you.
Dr.
Oppenheimer.
Don't let that crybaby back in here.
Robert saw that hand-wringing got him nowhere.
By the time I met him, he'd fully embraced his "father of the bomb" reputation.
And he used his profile to influence policy.
Doctor, in the years following the war, would you say that you exerted a great influence on the atomic policies of the USA?
I think "great" would be an overstatement.
Really?
If we look at the issue of isotopes, were you not personally responsible for destroying all opposition to their export?
You could use a bottle of beer...
In fact, you do.
I was the spokesman, but the opinion among scientists was unanimous.
All along with McCarthy on the rise, he knew he was vulnerable.
His brother was blacklisted by every university in the country.
Lomanitz wound up working the railroad, laying track.
And Chevalier went into exile.
But none of that stopped Robert from pushing the GAC to recommend arms control instead of the H-bomb.
He was devastated when Truman rejected their recommendation.
I miss Richard more than I can bear.
I know, Ruth, I know.
Part of me's glad he didn't live to see where this is all going.
Here comes the birthday boy.
To gloat.
Have fun.
Robert, uh, my son and his fiancée are desperate to meet the father of the atomic bomb, and so...
Well...
good day.
Is this a bad time?
What do you think, Lewis?
Well, I think it must have been a blow for you.
For the world.
The world?
What does Fuchs mean to the rest of the world?
Fuchs?
Klaus Fuchs?
Oh, dear.
You haven't heard.
Klaus Fuchs, the British scientist that you put onto the implosion team at Los Alamos, turns out he was spying for the Soviets the whole time.
I'm sorry.
After the truth about Fuchs came out, the FBI stepped up surveillance on him.
He knew his phone was tapped, he was followed everywhere, his trash picked through.
And maybe he thought fame could actually protect him.
When Eisenhower took office, he saw one more chance.
He took it.
America and Russia may be likened to two scorpions in a bottle, each capable of killing the other, but only at the risk of his own life.
Now, there are various aspects of this policy...
Lot of scientists blame me, but how was I supposed to protect him?
candor is the only remedy.
Officials in Washington need to start leveling with the American people.
That was the last straw for Robert's enemies.
So he had to lose his security clearance?
And with it, his credibility.
But how could they do it?
He was a war hero.
He'd already told everyone about his past.
Borden dredged it all up.
How could Borden get access to Oppenheimer's FBI file?
Could it have been Nichols?
No, I can't imagine he'd do that.
But whoever did unleashed a firestorm that burned a path from the White House back to my desk at the AEC.
You see him in there, right?
I've worked my whole life to get here, Cabinet of the United States of America, and now, in front of the entire country, they're gonna put me back in my place.
A lowly shoe salesman.
Lewis, we can win this thing.
I-I think we can get the Senate to grasp that you did your duty, painful though it was.
Now, will Hill's testimony back us up?
Hill will be fine.
I don't really know him, but he was one of Szilard's boys in Chicago, and they never forgave Robert for not supporting the petition against bombing Japan.
This was taken Virtually everyone in the street for nearly a mile around was instantly and seriously burned.
The Japanese spoke of people who wore striped clothing upon whom the skin was burned in stripes.
There were many who thought themselves lucky, who climbed out of the ruins of their homes, only slightly injured.
But they died anyway.
They died days or weeks later from the radium-like rays emitted in great numbers at the moment of the explosion.
Did you read this crap in the papers?
A British physicist is saying the atomic bombings were not the last act of World War II, but the first act of this cold war with Russia.
Which physicist?
I think you knew him.
Patrick Blackett.
He may not be wrong.
Stimson is now telling me we bombed an enemy that was essentially defeated.
Robert, you've all the influence now.
Please.
Urge them to continue my research on the Super.
I neither can nor will, Edward.
Why not?
It's not the right use of our resources.
Is that what you really believe?
J.
Robert Oppenheimer.
Sphinx-like guru of the atom.
Nobody knows what you believe.
Do you?
Hmm?
One final time, our program director, Dr.
J.
Robert Oppenheimer.
I hope that, in years to come, you will look back on your work here with pride.
But today that pride must be tempered with a profound concern.
If atomic weapons are to be added to the arsenals of a warring world, then the day will come when people will curse the name of Los Alamos.
Sorry, Admiral.
Stopped off to get this.
It seems pretty favorable.
There's Oppenheimer.
What's the caption?
Uh, "J.
Robert Oppenheimer, Strauss fought...
and the US won." That'll work.
Those were your words from the other day.
We needed to pivot.
But how would you know what Time magazine's gonna write?
Henry Luce is a friend.
You sat here and let me tell you how it's done, but you've been far ahead all along.
Survival in Washington is about knowing how to get things done.
Right.
What was it you said about Borden?
holding the knife yourself?" I'm beginning to think Borden was holding the knife for you.
It's gonna come down to how much influence Borden's been able to exert on Teller.
Did I say something funny?
Just "Borden, Borden, Borden" when we all know that it's Strauss.
Lewis brought me to Princeton, Kitty.
And then you humiliated him in front of Congress.
But more useful than a sandwich.
How'd I do?
Maybe a little too well, Robert.
That was six years ago.
You know the truly vindictive, patient as saints.
Strauss has been perfectly clear that he is neutral.
Wake up!
It is Strauss!
It's always been Strauss, and you know it.
Why won't you fight him?
Christ's sake.
It wasn't Nichols, or Hoover, or one of Truman's guys.
It was you.
You gave the file to Borden.
You set him on Oppenheimer.
You convinced him to...
Borden didn't take any convincing.
Take your time, use the entire file.
Write up your conclusions, send them to the FBI.
The material is obviously extensive, but there's nothing new here.
Your conclusions will be.
And they'll have to be answered.
Hoover passes them to McCarthy?
Oppenheimer's too slippery for that self-promoting clown.
I've talked it over with Hoover, he'll hold McCarthy at bay while you do this with the AEC.
A trial.
No.
No trial.
You can't give Oppenheimer a platform.
You can't martyr him.
We need a systematic destruction of Oppenheimer's credibility so he can never again speak on matters of national security.
Then what?
A shabby little room, far from the limelight.
A simple, bureaucratic procedure.
His Q clearance is up for renewal.
You send your accusations to the FBI...
Hoover sends them to the AEC, you're forced to act.
You write up an indictment.
You tell Oppenheimer his security clearance is not being renewed.
But offer him the chance to appeal.
As you can see, Robert, it's not yet signed.
May I keep this?
No.
If you do decide to appeal, they'll have to send you a copy.
When he appeals, and trust me, he will, I appoint a board.
They will, of course, have counsel.
Who?
Roger Robb.
Ouch.
Robb will have security clearance to examine Oppenheimer's file.
As will the Gray board.
Defense counsel will not.
A closed hearing.
information in your indictment of me..." No audience.
No reporters.
No burden of proof.
No burden of proof?
We're not convicting.
We're just denying.
What is it you said?
the game is played." Well, forgive my naivete.
Amateurs seek the sun...
get eaten.
Power stays in the shadows.
But, sir, you're out of the shadows now.
Yeah, that's why this has to work.
Well...
Teller's testifying this morning.
That'll help.
And then...
Hill is in the afternoon.
Hill is gonna help us too.
As you can see, Robert, it's not yet signed.
If you do decide to appeal, then they'll have to send you a copy.
Take my car and driver.
I insist.
I'll have to consult my lawyers, Lewis.
Of course.
But don't take too long.
I can't keep Nichols at bay.
I'm sorry it's come to this, Robert.
I think it's wrong.
Nichols wants me to fight so he can get it all on the record.
Strauss wants me to walk away.
Strauss knows that you can't do that.
You'd be accepting the charges.
You'll lose your job.
You will lose your reputation.
We'll lose our house.
Robert, we have to fight.
As AEC counsel, I can't represent you.
I'll call Lloyd Garrison.
I have to warn you, this won't be a fair fight.
During your interview with Boris Pash in 1943, did you refer to microfilm?
You never said, "Man of the consulate expert in the use of microfilm." I would like to know what document Mr.
Robb is quoting from and if we might be furnished with a copy.
The document is classified, Mr.
Garrison.
I think we should get back to firsthand information.
There was a recording of the interview.
You let my client sit here and potentially perjure himself and all this time, you had a recording?
Nobody told your client to misrepresent his former answers.
Misrepres...
It was 12 years ago.
Can we hear this recording?
You don't have the clearance, Mr.
Garrison.
Is this proceeding interested in entrapment or in truth?
If it's truth, where's the disclosure?
Where's the witness list?
Mr.
Garrison, this isn't a trial, as you're well aware.
Evidentiary rules do not apply.
We are dealing with national security.
Yes, sir, with all due respect, I fail to see how national security prevents the prosecution from providing us a list of witnesses.
Perhaps we are in need of a brief recess.
Gentlemen, you have my words.
If you say they're from a transcript, then I'll accept it.
I've already explained I made up a cock-and-bull story.
But why would anyone make up such an elaborate story?
Because I was an idiot.
Why lie?
Well, clearly with the intention of not revealing who the intermediary was.
Your friend, Haakon Chevalier, the communist?
Is he still your friend?
Yes.
Dr.
Rabi, thank you for coming.
Do you know who else the prosecution has called?
Teller, obviously.
Strauss told him that you and Ruth Tolman have been having an affair for years.
The whole time you lived with them in Pasadena.
He convinced Lawrence that Richard died of a broken heart.
The broken heart.
Richard never found out.
Is Lawrence gonna testify?
I don't know.
Dr.
Rabi, what governmental positions do you currently hold?
I am the chairman of the General Advisory Committee to the AEC, succeeding Dr.
Oppenheimer.
And how long have you known Dr.
Oppenheimer?
Since 1928.
I...
I know him quite well.
Well enough to speak to the bearing of his loyalty and character?
Dr.
Oppenheimer is a man of upstanding character.
And he is loyal to the United States, to his friends, to the institutions of which he is part.
Eat.
After the Russian A-bomb test, did Dr.
Lawrence come to see you about the hydrogen bomb?
You'd be better off asking him.
Well, I fully intend to.
Would you say that Dr.
Oppenheimer was unalterably opposed to the H-bomb?
No, he thought that a fusion program would come at the expense of our awfully good fission program.
But that proved not to be the case.
In the event, both could be done.
Suppose that this board did not feel satisfied that, in his testimony here, Dr.
Oppenheimer had been wholly truthful.
What would you say whether or not he should be cleared?
Why go through all this against a man who has accomplished what Dr.
Oppenheimer has?
Look at his record.
We have an A-bomb and a whole series of it.
We have a whole series of Super bombs.
What more do you want?
Mermaids?
But I've known Secretary Strauss for many years, and I feel it a necessity to express the warm support for science and scientists Lewis has shown.
We'll break now, unless there's any immediate business.
Senator, I'd like to once again request that we're furnished with a list of witnesses.
And I will remind the nominee that we don't always have that information in advance.
We do know that Dr.
Hill will be here after lunch.
Mr.
Chairman, our next scheduled witness, Dr.
Lawrence, has apparently come down with colitis.
So we'll proceed with William Borden instead.
Mr.
Borden, welcome.
Please take a seat.
Mr.
Borden, during your investigation into Dr.
Oppenheimer, And did there come a time when you expressed those conclusions in a letter to Mr.
J.
Edgar Hoover of the Federal Bureau of Investigation?
did you discuss the writing of the letter with anybody attached to the Atomic Energy Commission?
I have one in front of me.
Would you please be so kind as to read it, sir?
purpose of this letter is to state..." I'm sorry, I'm sorry, if I could have a...
What is the purpose of the delay?
He's simply gonna read the letter.
Mr.
Chairman, this is the first I've seen of this letter, and I see statements here, at least one, of a kind that I don't think anyone would like to see go into the record.
These are accusations that have not previously been made.
That are not part of the indictment from Nichols.
Accusations of a kind that I don't think belong here.
The witness wrote this letter on his own initiative, laying out evidence that has already been before the board.
His conclusions are valid testimony, just like the positive conclusions of friends of Dr.
Oppenheimer.
It cuts both ways.
How long has counsel been in possession of this letter?
I don't think I should be subject to cross-examination by you, Mr.
Garrison.
Mr.
Garrison, given that we on the board have all read the letter, wouldn't it be better to have it in the record?
Let's proceed.
the purpose of this letter is to state my opinion based upon years of study of the available classified evidence, that more probably than not J.
Robert Oppenheimer is an agent of the Soviet Union.
The following conclusions are justified.
One, between 1929 and 1942, more probably than not, J.
Robert Oppenheimer was a sufficiently hardened communist, that he volunteered information to the Soviets.
Two, more probably than not, he has since been functioning as an espionage agent.
Three, more probably than not, he has since acted under a Soviet directive in influencing United States military policy..." I'm sorry, Robert.
Is anyone ever going to tell the truth about what's happening here?
We will now hear from Dr.
David Hill.
Dr.
Hill, would you care to make a statement?
Thank you.
I've been asked to testify about Lewis Strauss.
A man who has given years of service in high positions of government and who is known to be earnest, hardworking and intelligent.
The views I have to express are my own, but I believe that much I have to say will help to indicate why most of the scientists in this country would prefer to see Mr.
Strauss completely out of government.
You're referring to the hostility of certain scientists directed toward Mr.
Strauss because of his commitment to security, as demonstrated in the Oppenheimer affair?
No.
Because of the personal vindictiveness he demonstrated against Dr.
Oppenheimer.
Order.
Order.
It appears to most scientists around this country that Robert Oppenheimer is now being pilloried and put through an ordeal because he expressed his honest opinions.
Dr.
Bush, I thought I was performing a service to my country when hearing this case.
No board in this country should sit in judgment of a man because he expressed strong opinions.
If you wanna try that case, you should try me.
Excuse me, gentlemen, if I become stirred.
But I am.
Dr.
Hill, we've already heard that Mr.
Strauss did not bring the charges, or participate in the hearings against Dr.
Oppenheimer.
The Oppenheimer matter was initiated and carried through largely through the animus of Lewis Strauss.
Oppenheimer made mincemeat out of Strauss's position on the shipment of isotopes to Norway, and Strauss never forgave him this public humiliation.
Another controversy between them centered around their differences in judgment on how the H-bomb would contribute to national security.
Strauss turned to the personnel security system in order to destroy Oppenheimer's effectiveness.
And Strauss was able to find a few ambitious men who also disagreed with Oppenheimer's positions and envied him his prestige in government circles.
I've always assumed, and still assume, that he's loyal to the United States.
I believe this.
And I shall believe it until I see very conclusive proof to the opposite.
Do you, or do you not, believe that Dr.
Oppenheimer is a security risk?
In a great number of cases, I have seen Dr.
Oppenheimer act in a way which was, to me, exceedingly hard to understand.
I thoroughly disagreed with him in numerous issues, and his actions, frankly, appeared to me confused and complicated.
To this extent, I feel, I want to see the vital interests of this country in hands which I understand better, and therefore trust more.
I'm sorry.
You shook his fucking hand?
Oh, I would have spit in his face.
Not sure the board would have appreciated that.
Is it not gentlemanly enough for you?
I think you're all being too goddamn gentlemanly.
Gray must see what Robb is doing.
Why doesn't he just shut him down?
And you shaking Teller's hand.
You need to stop playing the martyr.
Under the current AEC guidelines, would you clear Dr.
Oppenheimer today?
Under my interpretation of the Atomic Energy Act, which did not exist when I hired Dr.
Oppenheimer in 1942, I would not clear him today if I were on the commission.
Good, thank you, General, that is all.
But I don't think I'd clear any of those guys.
That's all.
Dr.
Oppenheimer had no responsibility in the selection or the clearance of Klaus Fuchs, did he?
No.
None at all.
And you wouldn't want to leave this board with any suggestion today that you're here questioning his basic loyalty to the United States and the operation of Los Alamos.
By no means.
I hope I didn't lead anyone to believe otherwise for an instant.
Thank you, General.
Okay.
We shouldn't keep them waiting.
She'll be here.
Do you even want her here?
Only a fool or an adolescent presumes to know someone else's relationship, and you're neither, Lloyd.
Kitty and I, we're grown-ups.
We've walked through fire together.
She'll do fine.
Would you describe your views on communism as pro, anti, neutral?
Very strongly against.
I've had nothing to do with communism since 1936, since...
since before I met Robert.
That's all.
The record demonstrates that Oppenheimer was not interrogated by impartial and disinterested counsel for the Gray board.
He was interrogated by a prosecutor who used all the tricks of a rather ingenious legal background.
You are charging now that the Gray board permitted a prosecution.
If I were on the Gray board, I would have protested against the tactics of the man who served, in fact, as the prosecuting counsel.
A man appointed, not by the board, but by Lewis Strauss.
Who was this?
I'm sorry?
Who was this?
Uh, Roger Robb.
Mrs.
Oppenheimer.
Did you have a Communist Party membership card?
I'm...
I'm not sure.
Not sure?
Well...
Well?
I mean, presumably, the act of joining the Party required sending some money and receiving a card, no?
Yeah.
Sorry.
Yeah.
It's just it was all so very long ago, Mr.
Robb, wasn't it?
Did you return the card or rip it up?
The card whose existence I've forgotten?
Can a distinction be made between Soviet communism and communism?
In the days when I was a member, I thought they were definitely two things.
I thought that the Communist Party of the United States was concerned with our domestic problems.
I now no longer believe this.
I believe the thing's linked together and spread all over the world, and I have believed this since I left the Party, 16 years ago.
Are you familiar with the fact your husband was making contributions to the Spanish Civil War as late as 1942?
I knew that Robert gave money from time to time.
Did you know this money was going into Communist Party channels?
I think you mean "through Communist Party channels," don't you?
Yes!
Yes?
Then would it be fair to say that this meant that by 1942, your husband had not stopped having anything to do with the Communist Party?
You don't have to answer that yes or no.
You can answer that any way you wish.
I know that, thank you.
It's your question.
It's not properly phrased.
Then why don't you answer it that way?
with the Communist Party." Because Robert never had anything to do with the Communist Party as such.
I know he gave money to Spanish refugees.
I know he took an intellectual interest in communist ideas...
Are there two types of communists?
Intellectual communists and your plain, old, regular commie?
Well, I couldn't answer that one.
I couldn't either.
Good evening.
Robert, you can't win this thing.
It's a kangaroo court with a predetermined outcome.
Why put yourself through more of it?
I have my reasons.
All right.
Good night.
He has a point.
I'm not sure you understand, Albert.
No?
I left my country never to return.
You served your country well.
If this is the reward she offers you, then...
perhaps you should turn your back on her.
Damn it, I happen to love this country.
Then tell them to go to hell.
Interestingly enough, this is no longer a confirmation hearing, it's now a trial about a trial!
It's not good he's telling everyone you initiated the hearings.
He can't prove a goddamn thing.
He certainly can't prove that I gave the file to Borden.
We're not in court, sir.
There's no burden of proof.
Right.
They're not convicting...
just denying.
But why would Hill come here to tear me down?
What's his angle?
Do people need a reason to do the right thing?
As he sees it.
I told you, Oppenheimer poisoned the scientists against me, right from that first meeting.
I don't know what Oppenheimer said to him that day, but Einstein wouldn't even meet my eye.
Oppenheimer knows how to manipulate his own.
And at Los Alamos, he preyed on the naivete of scientists who thought they'd get a say in how we used their work.
Don't ever think he was that naive himself.
Doctor.
During your work on the hydrogen bomb, were you deterred by any moral qualms?
Yes, of course.
But you still got on with your work, didn't you?
Yes, because this was work of exploration.
It was not the preparation of a weapon.
You mean it was more of an academic excursion?
No, it is not an academic thing whether you can build a hydrogen bomb.
It's a matter of life and death.
By 1942, you were actively pushing the development of the hydrogen bomb, weren't you?
Pushing's not the right word.
Supporting it and working on it, yes.
So when did these moral qualms become so strong that you actively opposed the development of the hydrogen bomb?
When it was suggested that it be the policy of the United States to make these things at all cost, without regard to the balance between these weapons and atomic weapons as part of our arsenal.
What do moral qualms have to do with that?
What do moral qualms have to do with it?
Yes.
Oppenheimer wanted to own the atomic bomb.
He wanted to be the man who moved the Earth.
He talks about putting the nuclear genie back in the bottle.
Well, I'm here to tell you that I know J.
Robert Oppenheimer, and if he could do it all over, he'd do it all the same.
You know he's never once said that he regrets Hiroshima?
He'd do it all over.
Why?
Because it made him the most important man who ever lived.
Well, we've freely used the atomic bomb...
In fact, Doctor, you assisted in selecting the target to drop the atomic bomb on Japan, didn't you?
that by dropping that atomic bomb on the target you selected, that thousands of civilians would be killed or injured, is that correct?
Yes, not as many as turned out...
Oh.
Well, how many were killed or injured?
On the day of each bombing?
It has been put at somewhere between 50,000 and 100,000.
Any moral scruples about that?
Terrible ones.
Yet you testified in here that the bombing of Hiroshima was very successful.
And it is also alleged to have helped end the war.
Would you have been supportive of the dropping of a hydrogen bomb on Hiroshima?
The target is too small.
Well, supposing there had been a target in Japan big enough for a thermonuclear weapon, would you have been opposed to the dropping of it?
This was not a problem with which I was confronted...
I'm confronting you with it now, sir.
It was all part of his plan.
He wanted the glorious, insincere guilt of the self-important to wear like a fucking crown.
Say, "No, we cannot go down this road," even as he knew we'd have to.
Would you have been opposed to the dropping...
Japan because of moral scruples?
Yes, I believe I would, sir.
Did you oppose the dropping of an atomic bomb on Hiroshima because of moral scruples?
I set forth our arguments against dropping it, but I did not endorse them.
You mean after working night and day for three years building the bomb, you then argued against the use of it.
I was asked by the secretary of war what the views of scientists were.
I gave him the views against and the views for.
You supported the dropping of the atom bomb on Japan.
I was not in a policy-making position at Los Alamos.
I would have done anything I was asked to do.
Then you would have built the H-bomb too, wouldn't you?
And the GAC report, which you co-authored after the Soviet atomic test, said a Super bomb should never be built.
What we meant...
What I meant was...
And wouldn't the Russians do anything to increase their strength?
If we did it, they would have to do it.
Our efforts would only fuel their efforts, just as it had with the atomic bomb.
with the atomic bomb," exactly!
No moral scruples in 1945, plenty in 1949.
Dr.
Oppenheimer...
when did your strong moral convictions develop with respect to the hydrogen bomb?
When it became clear to me...
that we would tend to use any weapon we had.
J.
Robert Oppenheimer the Martyr.
I gave him exactly what he wanted.
To be remembered for Trinity, not Hiroshima.
Not Nagasaki.
He should be thanking me.
Well, he's not.
Do we still have enough votes, or is the crowning moment of my career about to become the most public humiliation of my life?
Full Senate's about to vote.
You'll scrape through.
Great, then gather the fucking press.
Dr.
J.
Robert Oppenheimer.
This board, having heard testimony from you and many of your current and former colleagues, has come to the unanimous conclusion that you are a loyal citizen.
However, in the light of your continuing associations and disregard for the security apparatus of this country, together with your somewhat disturbing conduct on the hydrogen bomb program, and the regrettable lack of candor in certain of your responses to this board, we have voted two-to-one to deny the renewal of your security clearance.
A full written opinion, with a dissent from Mr.
Evans, will be issued to the AEC in the coming days.
That is all.
Gordon.
Robert.
Robert.
Don't, uh...
Don't take in the sheets.
You'll get your shot.
Is it official?
Well, there were a couple of unexpected holdouts.
I'm denied.
Yeah?
I'm afraid so, sir.
All right.
Who were the holdouts?
Um...
There were three, led by the junior senator from Massachusetts.
Young guy trying to make a name for himself, didn't like what you did to Oppenheimer.
What's his name?
Uh, Kennedy.
John F.
Kennedy.
Kitty?
Did you think that if you let them tar and feather you, that the world would forgive you?
It won't.
We'll see.
Goddamn it.
You told me I'd be okay.
Yeah, well, I didn't have all the facts, did I?
Here's a fact.
President Eisenhower pinned the Medal of Freedom on my chest last year, what's right for this country.
They don't want me in the Cabinet room?
Oh, that's...
That's fine.
Maybe they should just invite Oppenheimer instead.
Maybe they will.
I told you, he turned the scientists against me one by one, starting with Einstein.
I told you about Einstein.
I saw him by the pond.
You did, but you know, sir, since nobody really knows what they said to each other that day, is it possible they didn't talk about you at all?
Is it possible they spoke about something more important?
Mr.
Strauss!
Oh!
Thank you.
Albert.
Ah...
The man of the moment.
You once held a reception for me.
In Berkeley.
You gave me an award, Mmm?
Yes.
You all thought that I had lost the ability to understand what I'd started.
So, the award really wasn't for me.
It was for all of you, hmm?
Now it's your turn to deal with the consequences of your achievement.
And one day, when they've punished you enough...
they'll serve you salmon and potato salad.
Make speeches...
Hello, Frank.
You're happy, I'm happy.
Pat you on the back, tell you all is forgiven.
Just remember...
it won't be for you.
It'll be for them.
Albert.
When I came to you with those calculations, we thought we might start a chain reaction that would destroy the entire world?
Mmm.
I remember it well.
What of it?
I believe we did.
Are you watching closely?
Every magic trick consists of three parts or acts.
The first part is called the Pledge.
The magician shows you something ordinary...
He shows you this object...
Yeah, unaltered, normal.
But of course, it probably isn"t.
The second act is called the Turn.
The magician takes the ordinary something...
do something extraordinary.
Now, you"re looking for the secret, but you won"t find it...
you"re not really looking.
You don"t really wanna know.
You want to be fooled.
But you wouldn"t clap yet...
isn"t enough.
You have to bring it back.
That"s why every magic trick has a third act.
The hardest part.
The part we call the Prestige.
The Prestige.
And did Robert Angier, the Great Danton, your employer...
of his trick that night?
I saw someone making their way below stage.
I followed him.
It was Borden, watching Mr.
Angier drown.
Would you please describe your occupation to the jury, Mr.
Cutter?
I'm an ingenieur.
I design illusions and construct the apparatus necessary for performing them.
So, Mr.
Cutter...
beneath the stage...
No, no.
It was...
The tank was brought on for the first trick and then taken off-stage.
Borden must have placed it under the trap door after the interval.
How large was this tank?
Oh, it's a normal tank for escape underwater, about 4 or 500 gallons.
How do you think Mr.
Borden...
the trap door without anyone noticing?
He's a magician.
Ask him.
I ask again that this man explain the mechanics of Mr.
Angier's illusion.
The Real Transported Man...
in this business.
I have the right to sell it on.
If I reveal the method here, then the trick is worthless.
How can we know that the tank wasn't some part of the trick that went wrong?
Mr.
Cutter, I see your predicament...
hangs in the balance.
If you were prepared to disclose the details to me in private...
their relevance to the case.
Might this be an acceptable compromise?
I'm gonna have to ask you to turn out your pockets.
Not my idea, sir.
The warden saw his show in Manchester last year where he vanished into thin air.
He's convinced he'll try and escape.
I told him the only way that Borden's gonna disappear...
with the other inmates.
Check the locks.
Twice.
My name is owens.
I'm a solicitor.
I represent Lord caldlow, an accomplished amateur magician and historian...
How much?
Five thousand pounds.
Talk with Fallon, my ingenieur.
Money's for him.
Yes, I did.
He offered to sell me your tricks.
All except the most valuable one: The Transported Man.
Well, I wouldn't forgive myself for selling my greatest trick.
Even for your daughter?
If the newspapers are right and you are for the drop...
Bernard Fallon?
A man with a past almost as obscure as your own.
Courts motioned that the girl be removed from his care.
No, the girl will be an orphan.
I know you're no stranger to the workhouse.
It's better than here?
I'm offering you a way to wrap up your affairs with dignity.
And I'm offering your daughter a future.
As Lord caldlow's ward, she will want for nothing.
Ever.
Well, think it over.
And Lord caldlow would like you to have this as a show of good faith.
He said it might be of interest.
This is Robert Angier's diary.
Including the time he spent in colorado learning your trick.
On his return from colorado, he mounted a version of The Transported Man...
was better even than your original.
If you want Angier's secrets, you go dig him up and ask him yourself.
I want your secret, Mr.
Borden.
Consider your daughter.
A cipher.
An enigma.
A search.
A search for answers.
Even if Colorado is the end of my journey...
the rest of Borden"s secrets.
See, the cipher in his notebook is unlocked by a single word...
his writing and to know his mind.
Well, my passion is equal to the task.
Mr.
Angier?
Welcome to colorado Springs.
Well, quite a reception.
You're our first guest of the season, Mr.
Angier.
Your telegram didn't indicate how long you'll be staying with us.
For as long as it takes.
I'll need a coach tomorrow to take me up the mountain.
Well, the peak is closed, sir, for scientific experimentation.
Yes, I know.
That's why I'm here.
You'll have to walk the rest, I'm afraid, sir.
I'm amazed how many of you newspaper writers can't read my sign.
Not the welcome I was expecting.
I know you.
You're the Great Danton.
I saw your show in London seven times.
You guessed every object the audience had in their pockets.
I'm Alley.
Sorry about the fence.
People interfere with our work.
He made a machine for a colleague of mine sometime ago.
I brought a lot of money.
I'm sorry, Mr.
Angier.
I simply can't help you.
I'll be staying at the hotel.
Indefinitely.
Hey, what am I holding?
Your watch.
Borden"s journal entry for April 3rd, 1897, describes a show at the Orpheum Theater.
That was just days after he first met me.
We were two young men at the start of a great career.
Two young men devoted to an illusion.
Two young men who never intended to hurt anyone.
Which of you brave souls is willing to bind this lovely young woman?
If you would tie her wrists.
Bind her feet around the ankle.
Are either of you two gentlemen sailors?
I'm sure you can both tie a strong knot.
He's complacent, he's predictable, he's boring.
I mean, Milton has gotten success, whatever that means...
He won't take any risks at all.
I mean, he's squandering the goodwill of the audience...
Favorites?
Give me something fresh.
He won't even try a bullet catch.
A bullet catch is suicide.
All it takes is some smart-ass volunteer to put a button in the barrel.
Whatever.
The point is that a real magician tries to invent something new...
are gonna scratch their heads over.
And then you sell it to him for a small fortune.
I suppose you have such a trick.
No.
No one else could do my trick.
If Mr.
Borden has invented his masterpiece...
Milton is a great showman, but Borden is right.
He won't get his hands dirty.
If you wanna see what it takes to make real magic, go to the Tenley.
There's a chinaman there, and he really has what it takes.
I know the bloke on the door.
You two go and see that show...
can tell me...
the goldfish-bowl trick...
The top theatrical agent in London.
I saw you drop the knot again.
I mean, if that knot slips and Julia's on the hoist, she'll break a leg.
It's the wrong knot.
Like I said, the Langford double will hold tighter.
The Langford double isn't a wet knot.
It's too dangerous.
If the rope swells up, she won't slip it.
Hey, Borden, he said no.
Yeah, well, you know knots better than me, do you?
Listen, no more mistakes.
All right.
Yeah, do you?
You wanna take over?
Because I hired him to find out how virgil does the orange trick.
Of course you can't trust him.
I think he's all right.
Watch your sightlines.
If I can see you kissing your wife's leg every night...
at the ends of row three and four.
This is a performance right here.
This is why no one can detect his method.
Total devotion to his art.
Utter self-sacrifice, you know?
It's the only way to escape all this, you know.
All right.
I can barely lift this thing and it's not even filled with water.
Or fish.
Look.
I don't know.
Hang on a second.
He must be strong as an ox.
He's been pretending to be a cripple for years.
Any time he's in public.
Any time he goes out.
It's unthinkable.
Borden saw it at once, but I couldn't fathom it.
Living my whole life pretending to be someone else.
Not just your name.
Who you are and where you're from.
I promised my family I wouldn't embarrass them with my theatrical endeavors.
I thought of a name for you.
The Great Danton.
Do you like it?
Borden writes as if no one but he understood the true nature of magic.
But what does he know of self-sacrifice?
You bloody fool.
What's wrong?
See?
Look, now he'll bring it back.
No, he killed it.
No.
Look.
See?
He's all right.
He's fine.
He's a sharp lad, your son.
Oh, he's my nephew.
You're the lucky one today.
Are you watching closely?
Look closer.
Never show anyone.
They'll beg you and they'll flatter you for the secret, but as soon as you give it up...
You understand?
Nothing.
The secret impresses no one.
The trick you use it for is everything.
So I could use a cup of tea.
I'd scandalize the landlord.
I think not.
You think that's...?
Is that enough to keep me out?
I think so.
So I'll see you again?
Milk and sugar?
You built this, Mr.
Cutter?
Oh, no, sir.
This wasn't built by a magician.
This was built by a wizard.
A man who can actually do what magicians pretend to do.
Tell me, Your Honor, what happens with these things after the trial?
They've been sold to a Lord caldlow.
An avid collector, apparently very interested in the case.
Yeah, well, don't let him take this.
I'm sure beneath its bells and whistles it's got a simple and disappointing trick.
Most disappointing of all, sir...
It's real.
This is the tank Angier drowned in?
Yes.
This is the place where the performer's hand reaches through to the trick padlock.
A standard magical apparatus for escapes.
Yeah, with one important difference: This isn't a trick lock.
It's been switched for a real one.
What a way to kill someone.
They're magicians, Your Honor.
Showmen.
Men who live by dressing up plain and sometimes-brutal truths...
Even without an audience?
There was an audience.
You see, this water tank...
to these two men.
Particularly awful significance.
Which of you brave souls is willing to bind this lovely young woman?
If you would tie her wrists.
Bind her feet around the ankle.
Are either of you two gentlemen sailors?
No.
I'm sure you can both tie a strong knot.
Robert!
No!
No!
No!
Julia.
Julia.
Julia!
Julia!
I knew an old sailor once.
He told me he went overboard, tangled in the sails.
They pulled him out, but it took him five minutes to cough.
He said it was like going home.
What do you want, Borden?
I'm sorry for your loss, Angier.
Which knot did you tie?
I keep asking myself that.
I'm sorry, I just don't know.
You don't know?
I'm sorry.
You don't know?
You don't know?
Alfred?
Good news.
We got our first booking today.
He's a very enterprising soul, is Mr.
Fallon.
Money will come when we get the audience.
But what about until then?
I mean, what I earn, it's barely enough for us.
Don't worry about it.
I'll share half my food with him or something.
You're already going to be doing that with someone else.
Oh, my God.
We should have told Fallon.
That is great.
We're having a baby.
Alfred, what's this?
Oh, this is just the trick to wake Ackerman up at the end of my act.
Is it the masterpiece?
The great trick?
No, no, no.
The world is not ready for that one yet.
This is just your run-of-the-mill, daring, spectacular bullet catch.
Go on, shoot me.
No, no, not there.
Shoot me here.
Don't...
I'm sorry, Alfred, but I can't raise a child on my own.
Gunpowder...
A ramrod.
Hold out your hand.
The bullet is not even in the gun when the charge is fired.
Once you know, it's actually very obvious.
Well, I mean, you still get...
It's dangerous.
I mean, people still get killed doing that.
Somebody could get a smart-ass.
He can put a penny or a button...
somebody could put a bullet there.
Don't worry.
Don't worry...
anything happen.
Everything's gonna be all right...
Well, on some days it's not true, and today you don't mean it.
Maybe today you're more in love with magic than me.
I like being able to tell the difference.
It makes the days it is true mean something.
All right.
Metal rings, ladies and gentlemen.
If there are any ladies or gentlemen here.
Get out your gun, mate.
Get out your gun.
You're gonna need it.
Get a gun.
It's what you came for, is it?
So who wants to volunteer?
Me!
Me!
Me.
Watch it, cowboy.
Are you man enough, sir?
Yes.
Which knot did you tie, Borden?
Which knot did you tie, Borden?
I don't know.
He came in to demand an answer, and I told him the truth.
That I have fought with myself over that night.
One half of me swearing blind that I tied a simple slipknot...
that I tied the Langford double.
I can never know for sure.
How can he not know?
How can he not know?
He must know what he did.
He must.
Sarah, that bloody hurts.
I don't understand how it can be bleeding again.
It's as bad as the day it happened.
I'm sorry.
I need this to heal so I can go back to work.
Alfred, face things.
What tricks can you perform with this kind of injury?
I can do card pulls.
I can do some prop tricks.
I can still do that.
And I can do the trick that I've been telling you about.
The one that they're gonna remember me for.
Come on.
Never thought I'd find an answer at the bottom of a glass.
Hasn't stopped you looking.
Heard about a booking.
Nice little theater.
Young up-and-coming magician.
You got me a booking?
Why?
I wanna keep on working.
And who's gonna hire the ingenieur that killed Julia Mccullough...
at the orpheum?
Someone who knows it wasn't your fault.
Someone who knows Alfred Borden and his repertoire of exotic knots.
I hear he had a spot of bad luck catching a bullet south of the river.
That's a dangerous trick, that one.
We'll have to whitewash the windows...
of the public, but it will do.
Have you settled on a name?
Yes, I have.
The Great Danton.
It's a bit old-fashioned, isn't it?
No, it's sophisticated.
The birdcage can't be our climax.
Everybody knows it.
Then stay off the stage.
You're a magician, not a wizard.
You gotta get your hands dirty if you're gonna achieve the impossible.
In here, Miss wenscombe.
No point in you meeting Mr.
Angier if you don't fit.
On the right.
What's so hard about this?
Nothing.
But you're going down here.
Hold it.
Hold it there.
This has gotta go around there.
Breathe as little as possible.
Now, you see?
That'll go.
That'll flatten.
She's not experienced, but she knows how to present herself.
A pretty assistant is the most effective form of misdirection.
Thank you.
Ladies and gentlemen, for my final trick...
of two volunteers.
Mr.
Merrit, if you would oblige me?
Yeah.
Okay.
Bring your hand around.
There.
I put it around its foot.
And another one there.
Mr.
Merrit, if you'll place your hands on either side of the cage, please.
Thank you, olivia.
You best not be intending...
You ready?
All right.
One...
Two...
Well, that's bloody marvelous, cutter.
Very nice.
And the best part is...
I thought you said I had to get my hands dirty.
Someday perhaps you will.
I just had to know that you can.
I haven't had the chance to compliment your beautiful theater.
Well, it'll be a lot more beautiful when it's full.
Why should I worry?
If your tricks don't get them in, somebody else's will.
Maybe somebody willing to do a bullet catch or a water escape?
Cheap thrills, Mr.
Merrit.
People hoping for an accident, likely to see one too.
What would that do for your business?
Thank you.
Sir?
In the third row there.
Please stand up and show us your handkerchief.
This isn't mine.
Perhaps you'd be so good as to return it to the lady in the aisle.
I believe she has yours.
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I'm making so many mistakes.
I'm so nervous.
The audience doesn't seem to be responding.
They've seen a lot of tricks before, but not this next one.
Put a cloth over.
I'll make it a little harder then, shall I?
Two volunteers, please.
A lady and a gentleman to hold this cage with me.
I'll perform this feat in a manner never before seen by yourselves...
anywhere in the world.
Madam, if you'll place one hand on the back of the cage, one hand on the front.
Sir, one hand on the bottom of the cage, one hand on the top.
We have a week's engagement.
To perform magic, not butcher birds and break my customers' fingers.
Clear out.
Anything here in the morning gets burned.
I've hired a comedian.
You know I hate comedians.
Well, there's plenty of good theaters.
If we can come up with a new trick, change the name of the act...
The name stays.
Right.
Well, then the new trick's gonna have to be irresistible, then.
I have a couple of methods to try out.
And then we need a new angle on the presentation.
Oh, and if you need some inspiration...
at the Albert Hall this week.
Engineers, scientists, you know?
That sort of thing captures a public's imagination.
Mind if I join you?
Tesla sends me down here during the storms.
Perfect excuse to come join the Great Danton for a drink.
Two of them.
Beautiful, isn't it, huh?
God, I miss New York though.
And not much else.
Our work is secret.
Is that a cipher?
It's a rotating transposition that shifts every day of the diary.
Simple, but time-consuming to translate, even when you have the five-letter keyword.
Which is?
We magicians have a circle of trust.
You have a circle of trust with someone whose diary you stole?
Maybe I bought it.
And you're hoping to find a great secret in there.
I've already found it.
That's why I'm here.
Tesla built one for another magician.
Mr.
Tesla has built unusual machines for unusual people.
But he would never talk about it.
I understand discretion.
I just want the machine.
Finish your drink.
I wanna show you something.
I think you'll have a special appreciation for our work.
Who's gonna believe you?
Not long now.
Our equipment requires a great deal of current.
Tesla electrified the town in exchange for using the generators when we need to.
We do our tests when the townspeople are asleep.
Mr.
Tesla doesn't wanna scare anyone.
Where are the wires?
Exactly.
And I have to ride all of them before I get to bed.
I'll send word for you in a few days, Mr.
Angier.
Magic.
Real magic.
Now appearing only here at London's Royal Albert Hall.
One of the miracles of our age.
A technological marvel.
You've never seen anything like it in your lives.
Your eyes will not believe what they're witnessing.
The miracle of Nikola Tesla, ladies and gentlemen.
Free clean power.
Would you like to know the future?
The man speaking now is going to change the world.
Ladies and gentlemen, come one, come all.
Immediate seating, no waiting.
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry...
Part of Thomas Edison's smear campaign...
superior alternating current.
Mr.
Alley, please.
We have asked Mr.
Tesla to reconsider...
But I've been told he refuses to appear under any such restrictions.
Clear the hall!
This thing is gonna blow!
Where's the switch?
This is all perfectly safe.
Hey.
Hello, you.
Hello, Jess.
Have you had a nice day with Mummy?
Sarah, I love you.
Hello.
I saw happiness.
Happiness that should have been mine.
But I was wrong.
His notebook reveals that he never had the life that I envied.
The family life that he craves one minute...
demanding freedom.
His mind...
His mind is a divided one.
His soul is restless.
His wife and child tormented by his fickle and contradictory nature.
What do you think?
What do you think you'll call her?
I don't know.
Everybody needs a name.
So, what's hers?
Maybe Sarah.
That's a lovely name.
That's a lovely name.
You talk about what you wanna do for the rest of the day.
All right?
Go on.
You talk with her.
They're taking her away?
To the workhouse?
Now, you keep talking.
Tell owens I've reconsidered.
Take it.
Go on, take it.
It's for the best.
Let me see.
They're just stupid tricks, right?
Haven't helped you get out of here, have they?
Or can't you undo real locks, Professor?
Well, maybe I'm just biding my time.
Maybe one day I'll open my hand, get your attention, ask: Maybe a magic word or two.
And then I'll be gone.
How'd you get so famous, then, eh?
Magic.
Borden, get back here!
Thank you.
Shut up!
Get him down!
Thank you.
Who's got a bloody key?
February 8th, 1899.
Today, finally a breakthrough.
Tesla"s agreed to see me.
It's perfectly safe.
So this is the Great Danton.
Mr.
Alley has effused about your act to me on any number of occasions.
Hold out other hand.
What's conducting the electricity?
Our bodies, Mr.
Angier, are quite capable of conducting...
Have you eaten, Mr.
Angier?
I need something impossible.
You are familiar with the phrase, It's a lie.
Man's grasp exceeds his nerve.
Society only tolerates one change at a time.
The first time I tried to change the world...
Second time, I was asked politely to retire.
So here I am, enjoying my retirement.
Nothing is impossible, Mr.
Angier.
What you want is simply expensive.
If I were to build for you this machine...
merely as illusion?
Well, if people actually believed the things I did on-stage...
I mean, think of sawing a woman in half.
Mr.
Angier, have you considered the cost of such a machine?
Price is not an object.
Perhaps not, but have you considered the cost?
I'm not sure I follow.
Go home.
Forget this thing.
I can recognize an obsession.
No good will come of it.
Hasn't good come of your obsessions?
At first.
But I have followed them too long.
I am their slave, and one day, they will choose to destroy me.
If you understand an obsession, then you know you won't change my mind.
So be it.
Will you build it?
I have already begun to build it, Mr.
Angier.
I hope you enjoy the mountain air.
This will take some time.
I thought you'd gone.
I don't really have anywhere to go.
You've been sleeping here?
Cutter said it would be all right till we get another booking.
What are you doing?
Research.
Part of a magician's job is to watch his competition, to see what illusions...
You're going to do something to that man, aren't you?
Cutter's hoping you'll let things lie.
He says if Borden thinks things are even between you two...
Even?
My wife for a couple of his fingers?
He has a family now, right?
And he's performing again.
Borden is living his life just as he always intended, as if nothing had happened.
And look at...
Look at me, all right?
You're going to need a better disguise.
Need a volunteer.
What happened?
Did you hurt him?
What happened, Robert?
You, sir.
Just a rubber ball, yes?
Thank you.
Just a rubber ball, no.
Not normal.
Not a normal rubber ball.
It's magic.
He had a new trick.
Was it good?
It was the greatest magic trick I've ever seen.
Did they applaud when you saw it?
The trick was too good, it was too simple.
No, he's a wonderful magician.
He's a dreadful showman.
He doesn't know how to dress it up, how to sell...
No, no, no, it's too simple.
This is a complex illusion.
You only say that because you don't know the method.
It's a double at the end.
It's the only way.
I've seen him perform the trick three times now.
The same man comes out of that second cabinet.
It's the same man.
He wears padded gloves to hide his damaged fingers...
He doesn't know how to sell it to an audience, but I do.
Yeah, well, we can use it as a climax to the show.
Yes.
The man stole my life, I'm gonna steal his trick.
Robert, I don't know how Borden does the trick, so either...
You either wait for him to retire and buy the secret...
And the only way that I know how to do it is to find you a bloody good double.
All right.
Take a good look.
Let's get out there and find me.
Look.
Look.
What's that?
That is for you.
What's this for?
Come here.
But you went over all the...
Sarah, I'm allowed to change my mind, aren't I?
The act is taking off, soon we'll be in a bigger theater.
Things will work out.
I can't believe it.
Thank you.
Thank you.
It's beautiful.
Gerry?
Darling, look at you.
Mr.
Cutter, Mr.
Angier, I'd like you to meet Gerald Root.
A pleasure.
Pleasure to meet you fine gentlemen.
Would you like for me to tell you a little joke?
Come here.
There we are.
Yes?
Are you laughing now?
Oh, dear, I have to take a piss.
He's perfect.
He needs a little help...
he could be your brother.
I don't need him to be my brother, I need him to be me.
Give me a month.
Come around.
So you open the door and...
come on.
So if you come down through there...
It's going to be amazing, Robert.
Well, it has to be.
Borden's trick is getting noticed.
The place was packed today.
You went and saw his show again.
Ready to meet yourself, Mr.
Angier?
All I have to do is keep myself drunk...
to tell the difference.
Have a little faith, sir.
Now, would you favor us with a performance, Mr.
Root?
Jesus.
Yes, you would drink too if you knew the world half as well as I do.
Did you think you were unique?
I have been caesar.
I played Faust.
How difficult could it possibly be to play the Great Danton?
You can go back to being yourself now, Root, for nothing.
I'd rather be him for now.
I find it amusing.
My liege, I did deny no prisoners.
Root has to keep a low profile.
Anyone sees him, the game's up.
I don't know how you do these things.
I'm not sure I wanna know.
Have you thought what we should call the trick?
There's no point in being coy.
Borden calls his trick "The Transported Man." There's no point in being coy.
Borden calls his trick "The Transported Man." Ladies and gentlemen, much of what you've seen tonight...
or entertaining trifles.
Alas...
this next feat as illusion.
Watch carefully.
You'll see no trickery...
Merely a technique familiar to certain citizens of the orient...
of the Himalayas.
Indeed, many of you may be familiar with this technique...
do not be alarmed...
is considered safe.
To our achievement.
The manager says he's never seen a reaction like it.
At least he got to see it.
I spent the ovation hiding under the stage.
No one cares about the man who disappears into the box.
They care about the one who comes out.
I don't know.
Maybe...
Maybe we could switch before the trick.
I could be the Prestige and Root ends up below.
No, the anticipation of the trick is everything.
We need your showmanship to build up the suspense.
Once Root opens his mouth, it's over.
He can't introduce this trick.
Of course I can.
I'm the Great Danton.
Root, you bloody fool.
Get out of that wardrobe and makeup.
Anyone could walk in here at any minute.
Congratulations, all.
Life is not full of these moments, Robbie.
we worked hard.
we need to celebrate properly.
what's wrong?
Is it your wife?
No.
No, it's the trick.
It isn't good enough.
Borden's trick is nothing compared to ours.
He has no style.
well, he doesn't spend the finale hiding under the stage.
I need to know how he does it.
I need you to go and work for him.
work for him?
Are you joking?
You'll be my spy.
we just got our start.
You want me to leave?
That's how we advance.
Think of it, olivia.
we got people excited, but imagine what we could do with the reaI illusion.
we'd have the greatest magic act anyone's ever seen.
He knows I work for you.
Exactly why he'll wanna hire you.
He'll want my secret.
Good girI.
You must be curious to see what so much money has bought you, Mr.
Angier.
It's fitting you should be here for maiden voyage.
Your hat.
You might wanna stand back.
I don't understand.
Perhaps it would be best if you left us to it.
She's just a little temperamentaI sometimes.
You here to steaI my show?
I'm here to give it what it's missing.
I was just saying that, wasn't I, Bernard?
woman's touch.
I mean, you're only the mistress of my enemy.
why wouldn't I trust you?
I'm going to tell you the truth.
Now that is a slippery notion in our line of work...
I am here because he sent me here.
He wants me to work for you and steaI your secret.
what does he need my secret for?
His trick is top-notch.
He vanishes and then he reappears on the other side of the stage...
unless I'm mistaken, very drunk.
It's astonishing.
How does he do it?
And tell me, olivia, does he enjoy taking his bows under the stage?
No, it's killing him.
He's obsessed with discovering your methods.
He thinks of nothing eIse.
He takes no pleasure in our success, and I've had enough.
There is no future with him.
He sent me here to steaI your secrets, but I've actually come to offer you his.
This is the truth, is it?
Think you'd better get dressed, sir.
Root, you're late and more drunk than usuaI.
No, we need to have a little chat, Mr.
cutter.
we have a problem.
cutter, Borden is performing right across the street.
Yeah?
we have a bigger problem.
Root.
He's realized he can make demands.
wha--?
He's blackmailing us?
I was surprised, to tell you the truth.
It usually takes them longer to figure it out.
well, look at yesterday's, look at last week...
the premier stage performer in London.
Not magician, mind you.
My point is, Robert, is you've climbed too high...
with professionaI embarrassment.
we don't do any tricks we can't controI.
Just pay him whatever he wants for now.
we keep doing the trick untiI Borden opens and then we'll phase it out.
All right.
Cutter was always surprised how fast Root turned bad.
To what do I owe the pleasure of this rather weIcome pint of ale?
You're the Great Danton, aren't you?
of course I am, but don't advertise it because I'll be mobbed with fans.
We paid him enough to keep him in beers...
to rock the boat.
Indeed, many of you may be familiar with this technique.
But for those of you who aren't, do not be alarmed...
is considered safe.
And who are you?
I am a humble admirer and a fellow practitioner.
very good.
well, I'm only doing one show...
pretty much run things these days.
Get up there!
Get up!
Your illusion, The Transported Man...
to know your methods or anything...
and I used a double.
I see.
very good.
well, it was, and then it went bad.
what I didn't count on, was that when I incorporated this bloke into my act...
complete power, you say.
Be very careful giving someone that power over you.
well, thank you.
Yes, thank you for the warning.
cheers.
I cannot claim this next feat as illusion.
what you're about to see is considered safe.
The Great Danton.
I apologize.
There simply is too much magic...
across the street.
Pardon my intrusion.
He does try so very hard.
I don't know how Borden found him.
Kept him under wraps, I was careful.
Yeah, well, he did.
Do you think it was her?
You weren't expecting me?
I was expecting you sooner.
Your message said afternoon.
It takes a bit for me to get around these days.
He's taken everything from me.
My wife, my career, now you.
what do you mean?
You sent me-- I sent you to steaI his secret, not to improve his act.
Makeup, glasses, wigs.
we don't use it for the show, but I've seen it backstage.
It's misdirection.
He leaves things around to make you think he's using a double.
All the time?
He doesn't know when I look.
All the time, olivia!
That's who he is!
That's what it takes!
He lives his act!
Don't you see?
Just because you're sleeping with him doesn't mean he trusts you.
You think you can see everything, don't you?
But the Great Danton is a blind fooI.
His notebook.
You stole it?
I borrowed it for tonight.
I thought you could translate it, but now-- olivia, no one can, it's a cipher.
Even with the keyword it would take months to decode.
If I don't get that back to him tomorrow, he'll know I took it.
This is his diary, olivia.
All of his secrets are right here in my hands.
won't bring your wife back.
I don't care about my wife, I care about his secret.
Look...
and stage a break-in.
Understand?
Robert.
I have fallen in love with him.
Then I know how hard this has been for you.
Notebook?
Then he's just getting started.
Professor.
Let him come.
I don't care.
Saves me cutting you an air hole.
You're finally getting your hands dirty.
It's what a good trick costs, Angier.
Risk.
Sacrifice.
The sacrifice, I'm afraid, is gonna be yours, unless you give me what I want.
My secret?
Your method for The Transported Man.
Fallon wouldn't tell me.
He doesn't seem to taIk at all.
You have my notebook.
Useless without the keyword.
write down your method, Mr.
Borden.
Describe it in full.
I want the whole method, not the keyword.
I don't even know if your secret's in your notebook.
The keyword is the method.
where's my ingenieur?
Fallon!
You hear me?
Fallon!
cutter, I haven't looked yet.
I wanted you to share this.
I aIready know how he does it, Robert.
The same way he aIways has.
The same way as we do.
It's just that you want something more.
well, let's find out then, shall we?
what does it mean?
It means, cutter, we have a journey ahead of us.
Listen to me.
obsession is a young man's game.
I can't.
I'm sorry.
Then the rest is up to me.
I'm sorry.
Good evening.
Hello, darling.
champagne, your finest.
I didn't know we were going to be joined for dinner.
Mr.
Fallon.
well, what are we celebrating?
well, we've hit upon a new trick, haven't we, Fallon?
I am going to bury myseIf alive every night...
and dig me up.
wonderful.
Right.
Sarah, don't taIk to me like that.
I'm not a child.
My husband's being a bore.
Good night, Mrs.
Borden.
Good night, Freddy.
well, couldn't you have at least taken off the beard?
Sarah, I just came from the bloody theater just now.
All right?
And I'm out in public.
I had a terrible ordeaI today.
I thought that something very precious...
So I just wanted to celebrate.
Just a little.
All right, what?
what did you lose?
I see, more secrets.
Sarah, secrets are my life.
This isn't you.
Stop performing.
I thought I had the place to myseIf, Mr.
Brent.
Unexpected guests.
Not very polite.
A lot of questions.
First I thought they might work for the government.
They work for Thomas Edison.
Today, a most curious development.
His assistant came to us with a proposition.
Obviously, Angier has sent her and told her to admit as much.
Does he enjoy taking his bows under the stage?
He sent me here to steaI your secrets, but I've actually come to offer you his.
This is the truth, is it?
No, that's what he told me to tell you.
The truth...
and he sent me to you...
to pick up his shirts.
I hate him for that.
I can spot Angier's methods from the back of the theater.
So, what could you possibly have to offer me?
You know how he does his tricks, but you can't understand...
You hide this.
I had to look very closely to spot it when you were performing The Transported Man...
It shows the audience you aren't using a double.
You mustn't hide it, display it proudly.
I'm sure it takes great skill to perform illusions with one good hand.
Yeah, it does.
So let people know.
You could be so much more than he is, and I can show you how.
I think she"s telling the truth.
I think we cannot trust her.
But I love her.
I need her.
To open myself to such a relationship...
But how to be sure?
I know a way.
It"s the only way to know her mind.
How could he send you away?
She must help me rid ourselves of Angier.
Today, my mistress proves her truthfulness.
Not to me, you understand.
I"ve been convinced since she led me to Root.
Today, Olivia proves her love for me to you, Angier.
Yes, Angier.
She gave you this notebook at my request.
And, yes, ''Tesla '' is merely the key to my diary, not to my trick.
Did you really think I"d part with my secret so easily after so much?
Goodbye, Angier.
May you find solace for your thwarted ambition back in your American home.
Tesla!
Tesla!
Alley!
Alley!
Tesla never made a machine like the one I asked for.
You stole my money because your funding had been cut off.
You've been shooting sparks at my top hat, laughing at me all along...
to stave off ruin.
In the hoteI.
And I have every mind to bring them up here myseIf.
That would be unwise, Mr.
Angier.
It is true that you are our last remaining financier...
Sir, my cat.
when I told you I could make your machine, I spoke a simple truth.
The machine simply does not operate as expected.
It requires further examination.
we tried the damn thing a dozen times.
The hat went nowhere.
we need to try different materiaI.
It may provoke a different result.
copernicus, come on.
You are responsible for whatever happens to this animaI, doctor.
I hope that whatever you were really doing with my money was more worthwhile...
Alley!
So the machine was working.
I never bothered to check the calibration because the hat never moved.
These things never quite work as you expect them to, Mr.
Angier.
That's one of the principaI beauties of science.
I'll need a couple of weeks to iron out the problems with the machine.
we'll send word when it's ready.
Don't forget your hat.
You look so pretty in this new dress of yours.
Then go to the zoo we shall.
So Daddy will go run his errands and I'll be back before you know it...
we'll go see those chimpanzees.
Sarah.
what are you doing?
we each of us have our vices.
Sarah, whatever you may think...
is our little girI.
I love you.
I will aIways love you and you alone.
which makes it so much harder when you don't.
Is that more shopping?
She does love the smell of money.
The little lady wants to go to the zoo, so I thought you could take her.
Yeah?
I mean, I can do it tomorrow if not.
And Sarah, she knows.
She-- I mean, at least she knows that something's not right...
to heIp me with her.
TaIk to her.
Just convince her that I do love her.
It's nothing.
It's just, you know, there's sometimes....
you're with me.
Leave your family at home where they belong.
I'm trying.
I'm trying, olivia.
I saw Fallon hanging around again.
There's something about that man I don't trust.
You trust me?
Then trust Fallon.
He protects the things that I care about.
we're sorry to see you go, Mr.
Angier.
we were sorry to see Mr.
Tesla leave as well.
He was very good to colorado Springs.
Mr.
Angier, I didn't think it was necessary to tell Edison's men about the box.
what box?
I apologize for leaving without saying goodbye...
my welcome in Colorado.
The truly extraordinary is not permitted in science and industry.
Perhaps you"ll find more luck in your field, where people are happy to be mystified.
You will find what you are looking for in this box.
Alley has written you a thorough set of instructions.
I add only one suggestion on using the machine: Destroy it.
Drop it to the bottom of the deepest ocean.
Such a thing will bring you only misery.
Tesla"s warning is as unheeded as he knew it would be.
Today, I tested the machine...
hadn"t ironed out the kinks in its operation.
I mean, if it went wrong, I would not wanna live like that for long.
But here at the Turn, I must leave you, Borden.
Yes, you, Borden.
Sitting there in your cell...
Angier's journaI, that gesture of good faith, that's a fake.
I assure you, it's not.
The provenance of the journaI is clear and under no doubt.
And it's written in Angier's own hand, of which we had numerous examples.
It don't matter.
So my tricks.
well, Lord caldlow will be very pleased indeed.
No, he won't.
Because they're not complete.
It's just the Pledge and the Turn for each.
without the Prestige for these tricks...
You get the rest of it when you bring my daughter here.
I wanna say goodbye.
we have to go through it now.
Listen, we have to go through it now.
Now, listen to me.
Deny it all you want.
olivia means nothing.
No, I'll go to her.
I know what you really are, AIfred.
I....
Sarah, shut up.
I don't wanna hear it anymore!
You can't taIk like this!
You can't hide it anymore because I know, AIfred, I know.
I know what you really are!
AIfred...
oh, well, you think I can live like this?
You think I bloody enjoy living like this?
what is so wrong with your life?
AIfred, I can't live like this!
well, what do you want from me?
I want....
I want you to be honest with me.
No tricks...
Do you--?
Do you love me?
Not today.
No.
who's there?
I'm looking for an old friend.
I heard about a booking.
Nice little theater.
Good up-and-coming magician.
Good rehearsaI space.
Blind stagehands, I like it.
You aIways had a good eye for publicity.
I need your heIp, John.
It's my last show.
A limited engagement.
Your last show?
A wise man once told me obsession was a young man's game.
I'm aImost done.
There's one thing left.
The ReaI Transported Man.
You wanna design a show around it.
I don't want you backstage.
I need you front of house, managing.
I need you to call in favors or connections you have...
The sort that Borden can't ignore.
what an honor it is to see you again, sir.
You told me you only wanted to show me one trick.
It piqued my interest.
Likewise, I'm sure.
well, let's get on, shall we?
Turn it on, gentlemen.
very pretty.
That's it, cutter?
He simply disappears?
That's not a trick.
well, he has to come back.
There has to be a-- Pardon me.
It's very rare to see...
Yes.
But you'll have to dress it up a little.
Disguise it.
Give them enough reason to doubt it.
You haven't spoken about her, Freddy.
Not once.
why would I taIk about her to you?
Because she was a part of your life.
And now she's gone.
You know, the day before she killed herseIf, she said she wanted to meet me.
That she had something to tell me about you.
I was such a coward, I couldn't bring myseIf to face her.
But...
You wanna know the truth about me?
Truth is that...
I never loved her.
Part of me did, but the other part didn't.
The part that found you.
The part that's sitting here right now.
I love you.
No, olivia, I love you.
That's the truth.
That is the truth that matters.
You could be in some other restaurant with some other woman right now...
It's inhuman to be so cold.
He's back.
After two years.
He's got a new trick.
They're saying it's the best London's ever seen.
You should see the look on your face, Professor.
You should go to him.
You two deserve each other.
I'm afraid I'm booked.
The Moscow Ballet, they'll be playing through next year.
Then get rid of them.
There'll be a hundred performances.
No more, no less.
Five performances a week.
No matinees.
And that's what you'll be charging for each ticket.
Good day.
Ladies and gentlemen, my first trick of the evening...
Anyone in the audience who would be irrevocably damaged...
should leave now.
For when I tell you the young lady who taught me this illusion...
of the dangers invoIved.
Let's begin.
In my traveIs, I have seen the future...
The world, ladies and gentlemen...
and terrifying possibilities.
what you're about to witness is not magic.
It is purely science.
I would like to invite you to come up on-stage now...
for yourseIves.
Man's reach exceeds his imagination.
Bravo!
Bravo!
Bravo!
Bravo.
Bravo.
one hundred performances.
why?
Does his method dictate that?
Is it a publicity move?
what is it?
He's a no-talent magician, and they're calling him...
Fifty yards in a second.
In a second!
And all that we know is he uses a trap door.
Brilliant.
what is going on under that stage?
why can't you outthink him?
They do this every night?
After each performance, yeah?
we're done.
All right?
Let him have his trick.
I don't need-- I don't need his secret.
So...
you leave him alone.
Both of us, just leave him alone.
we're done.
I told you, John...
on this one.
I would like to invite you to come up on-stage now...
for yourseIves.
who was that?
Hey!
where's the bloody key?
where's the bloody key?
The blind man's got it!
where's the bloody key?
Bloody drowning!
Hold on!
what have you done?
AIfred Borden, you have been found guiIty of the murder of Robert Angier.
You will be hanged by the neck untiI dead.
May the Lord have mercy on your soul.
Mr.
cutter?
owens.
oh, thank you for coming, Mr.
owens.
It has fallen to me to dispose of Mr.
Angier's equipment.
But I noticed from this manifest...
has purchased the bulk of the items.
Mr.
cutter, if you needed to know where to deliver these items, surely you-- No, no.
It's just there is one particular item...
well, I'm afraid Lord caldlow was adamant about purchasing this particular item.
Do you think I could taIk to Lord caldlow in person?
out of the question, I'm afraid.
of course...
of your delivery arrangements...
Got a visitor.
Lord caldlow.
with a little girI.
Jess?
Hello, my love.
How are you?
I've missed you so much.
And Fallon's missed you too.
we both have.
Daddy, can I come in there?
Not right now.
Not right now, darling.
No, but everything is gonna be all right.
Yes, I am.
I aIways have been.
They flatter you with all those chains, AIfred.
Don't they know you can't escape without your little rubber ball?
I pulled you out.
out of that tank.
All I wanted to do was prove that I was a better magician...
I don't know what you've done...
to get your hands dirty anymore, are you?
No, not anymore.
And I win.
Because no one cares about the man in the box, the man who disappears.
You win?
This ain't a bloody competition anymore, Angier, this is my little girI's life.
And don't you dare put her in the middle of this.
oh, I know how hard it is to have someone so speciaI...
And you can't take her with you now, can you?
oh, she'll be looked after.
Here.
That's what you're after.
That's what this is about.
Take it.
You aIways were the better magician.
we both know that.
But whatever your secret was, I mean, you have to agree...
Don't do this.
Don't do this, Angier, no.
Jess, Jess, Jess.
Jess, I'm gonna take you home soon.
I promise.
I promise.
Angier.
Angier!
what, you think this place can hold me?
Angier!
They're gonna bloody hang me!
They're gonna bloody hang me!
You can put a stop to this now!
Listen, that man is the one I'm meant to have killed!
You blind bastard, listen to me!
Run along now.
Sir.
There's a gentleman waiting.
Dear God.
Hello, cutter.
You're-- You're still alive.
How is it you're still alive, Robert?
I saw you on a slab, for God's sake.
Good night, Jess.
I've seen her before.
I saw her in court with Fallon.
She needs her father.
You're letting him hang, and I heIped you.
I came here to beg Lord caldlow to let me destroy that machine.
I am not gonna beg you for anything.
You don't have to.
I'm gonna make sure that machine's never used again.
Then, Lord caldlow...
My theater.
It belongs with the Prestige materiaIs.
John, I tried not to invoIve you.
So...
Both of us.
only I don't have as far to go as you.
No.
You were right, I should have left him to his damn trick.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry for a lot of things.
I'm sorry about Sarah.
I didn't mean to hurt her.
I didn't.
You go live your life in full now, all right?
You live for both of us.
Goodbye.
Are you watching closely?
Put it down the end.
Take a minute to consider your achievement.
I once told you about a sailor who described drowning to me.
Yes, he said it was like going home.
I was lying.
He said it was agony.
AIfred Borden...
and the High court of England...
No one cares about the man in the box.
cutter?
cutter?
Do you have anything to say?
Abracadabra.
A brother.
A twin.
You were Fallon the whole time.
No.
we were both Fallon.
And we were both Borden.
were you--?
were you the one who went into the box...
we took turns.
The trick is where we would swap.
cutter knew.
cutter knew.
But I told him it was too simple, too easy.
No.
Simple maybe, but not easy.
There"s nothing easy about two men sharing one life.
I don't understand how it can be bleeding again.
what about olivia?
And your wife?
we each loved one of them.
I loved Sarah.
He loved Olivia.
we each had haIf of a full life, really, which was enough for us.
Just.
But not for them.
See, sacrifice, Robert, that's the price of a good trick.
But you wouldn't know anything about that, would you?
I've made sacrifices.
It takes nothing to steaI another man's work.
It takes everything.
No.
No.
No, wait!
I'm the--!
It took courage.
It took courage to climb into that machine every night...
if I'd be the man in the box...
Do you wanna--?
Do you wanna see what it cost me?
You didn't see where you are, did you?
Look.
Look.
I don't care.
You went haIfway around the world.
You spent a fortune.
You did terrible things.
Really terrible things, Robert.
And all for nothing.
You never understood why we did this.
The audience knows the truth.
The world is simple.
It's miserable.
Solid all the way through.
But if you could fooI them, even for a second...
And then you....
Then you got to see something very speciaI.
You really don't know?
It was-- It was the look on their faces.
Every magic trick consists of three parts or acts.
The first part is called the Pledge.
The magician shows you something ordinary.
The second act is called the Turn.
The magician takes the ordinary something...
something extraordinary.
But you wouldn"t clap yet...
isn"t enough.
You have to bring it back.
Hey.
Now you"re looking for the secret.
But you won"t find it because, of course, you"re not really looking.
You don"t really want to work it out.
You want to be fooled.
THE END Subtitles by: Reklame Hey!
We live in a twilight world.
We live in a twilight world.
And there are no friends at dusk.
You've been made.
This siege is a blind for them to vanish you.
But I established contact.
Bring you in or kill you.
I have two minutes.
Make up your mind.
Where's the package?
Coat check.
Stay.
No friends at dusk, huh?
You'll do.
Get him to the rally point.
Swap clothes.
The Ukrainians are expecting a passenger.
I've never seen encapsulation like this.
We don't know how old it is, but it's the real deal.
Did you have an out?
Service tunnel to the sewer.
Take this.
Take him.
Take his exit.
I don't trust ours anymore.
Can you defuse that?
It's centrally synchronized.
Are there more?
Covering their tracks.
That's not our mission.
Mine now.
Walk away.
You don't have to kill these people.
That wasn't one of us.
I'll take the help.
Go, go, go.
A man can be trained to hold out for about 18 hours, so your colleagues will be clear by 7:00.
He didn't last 18 minutes.
He didn't have anything to hide.
You were smuggling a nobody.
It's risky.
Or were you counting on this?
Death.
CIA issue.
Spare yourself, once they clear.
Almost 7:00.
Uh-oh.
It's running fast.
We have to put it back one hour.
Get it out!
Welcome to the afterlife.
You've been in a medically-induced coma while we got you out of Ukraine and rebuilt your mouth.
The suicide pills are fake.
Why?
A test.
A test?
They pulled my teeth out.
Did my team get clear?
No.
Private Russians, we think.
Somebody talked.
Not you.
You chose to die instead of giving up your colleagues.
We all believe we'd run into the burning building.
But until we feel that heat, we can never know.
You do.
I resign.
You don't work for us.
You're dead.
Your duty transcends national interests.
This is about survival.
Whose?
Everyone's.
There's a cold war, cold as ice.
To even know its true nature is to lose.
This is knowledge divided.
All I have for you is a gesture in combination with a word.
Use it carefully.
It'll open the right doors, but some of the wrong ones, too.
That's all they've told you?
That test you passed?
Not everybody does.
With a high-vis vest and a clipboard, you can get almost anywhere.
Almost.
An obscure tenet.
No small talk.
Nothing that might reveal who we are or what we do.
I thought I was here to find out what we do.
You're not here for "what," you're here for "how." and not my business.
Well, to do what I do...
I need some idea of the threat we face.
As I understand it, we're trying to prevent World War III.
Nuclear holocaust?
No.
Something worse.
Aim it and pull the trigger.
It's empty.
Aim it.
Check the magazine.
How?
One of these bullets is like us, traveling forwards through time.
The other one's going backwards.
Can you tell which is which?
How about now?
It's inverted.
Its entropy runs backwards.
So, to our eyes, its movement is reversed.
We think it's a type of inverse radiation triggered by nuclear fission.
You didn't make it?
No, we don't know how yet.
So, where'd it come from?
Someone's manufacturing them in the future.
They're streaming back at us.
Try it.
You have to have dropped it.
How can it move before I touch it?
From your point of view, you caught it.
But from the bullet's point of view, you dropped it.
But cause comes before effect.
No, that's just the way we see time.
Well, what about free will?
That bullet wouldn't have moved if you hadn't put your hand there.
Either way we run the tape, you made it happen.
Don't try to understand it.
Feel it.
Instinct.
Got it.
Why does it feel so strange?
You're not shooting the bullet, you're catching it.
Whoa.
I've seen this type of ammunition before.
In the field?
I was almost hit.
Then you were exceedingly lucky.
An inverted bullet passing through your body would be devastating.
Not pretty.
These look like today's.
They may have been made today and inverted years from now.
Where did you get them?
Came with the wall.
I was assigned it, like all the material I'm studying here.
Do you have an analysis on the metals?
Sure.
Why?
The mixture of alloys can tell me where they might have been made.
Look...
I'm not seeing Armageddon here.
The bullet may not seem like much, but it's a simple machine.
Lead bullet, brass casing, gunpowder.
If they can invert that, I see no reason they couldn't invert pretty much anything.
Even a nuclear weapon can only affect our future.
An inverted weapon might be able to affect our past as well.
Now that we know what to look for, we're finding more and more inverted material.
Remnants of complex objects.
What do you think we're seeing?
The detritus of a coming war.
I was told you left the building.</i> Even the dead need allies.
I need an assist in Mumbai.
I need to get to Sanjay Singh.
And his house is...</i> I'm looking right at it.
It seems you need an introduction to a prominent Mumbai local on short notice.
I'm Neil.
I need an audience with Sanjay Singh.
That's not possible.
Ten minutes tops.
Time isn't the problem.
It's getting out alive that's the problem.
Would you take a child hostage?
A woman?
If I had to.
I'm not looking to make much noise here.
Yes?
Vodka tonic.
And a Diet Coke.
What?
You never drink on the job.
You're well-informed.
Well, pays to be in our profession.
Well, I prefer soda water.
No, you don't.
How's your parachuting?
I broke an ankle during basic training.
Singh's house isn't tall enough to parachute off of.
It's bungee-jumpable.
I don't think "bungee-jumpable" is a word.
It may not be a word, but it may be our only way out of that place.
Or into it, for that matter.
I know you're tired.
I'm also very tired.
Stay back.
I was almost taken out by a very unusual type of ammunition in Ukraine.
I want to know who supplied it.
My name is Sanjay.
And you are?
No chitchat?
There's no one at the other end.
No one who's gonna help you, anyway.
Don't let it get cold.
Why should I know who supplied it?
Combination of metals is unique to India.
If it's from India, it's from you.
Deduction, then.
Look, my friend...
guns are never conducive to a productive negotiation.
I'm not the man they send to negotiate.
Or the man they send to make deals.
But I am the man people talk to.
I can't.
I can't tell you.
You're an arms dealer, friend.
This may be the easiest trigger I've ever had to pull.
To say anything about a client would violate the tenets he lives by.
If tenets are important to you, then you can tell me.
Everything.
Not while you have a gun to my husband's head.
Sanjay, make a drink for our guest, please.
This is your operation?
A masculine front in a man's world has its uses.
The dealer you're looking for is Andrei Sator.
The Russian oligarch.
Made his billions in gas.
Moved to London.
Said to be on the outs with Moscow.
Very good.
Except the gas he made his billions from was actually plutonium.
None of which explains how or why you sold him inverted munitions.
When I sold him the rounds, they were perfectly ordinary.
So how did he get them inverted?
We believe he's functioning as some sort of a broker.
Between our time and the future.
He can communicate with the future?
We all do, don't we?
E-mails, credit cards, texts.
Anything that goes into the record speaks directly to the future.
The question is, can the future speak back?
And I'm supposed to find out?
To get anywhere near Sator would take a fresh-faced protagonist.
And you are fresh as a daisy.
Get close.
Find out what he's receiving and how.
Is it safe to involve British Intelligence?
I have a contact who's out of Sator's reach.
You must've had a plan for getting out.
Not one I love.
May I help you, sir?
I'm Mr.
Crosby's lunch.
I presume you mean Sir Michael Crosby's lunch.
Presume away.
If you'll follow me.
Started without you.
Hope you don't mind.
I'll catch up.
Same for me, please.
I'll send the waiter.
No, just pass on the order.
I gather you have an interest in a certain Russian national.
Anglo-Russian.
So I have to watch my step.
Indeed.
He's tapped into the intelligence services.
I've warned them he's feeding them rubbish...
but they don't seem to care.
Tell me about him.
I assume you're familiar with the Soviet-era secret cities.
Closed cities, not shown on maps.
Built around sensitive industries.
Most of them have been opened up and renamed as regular towns.
Not the one Sator grew up in.
Stalsk-12.
In the '70s, it had a population of about 200,000.
Thought to be abandoned.
Abandoned?
Some kind of accident.
After which it was used for underground tests.
Two weeks ago, same day as the Kiev opera siege, we spotted a detonation in northern Siberia, just where Stalsk-12 was.
Sator emerged from this blank spot on the map with ambition...
and enough money to buy his way into the British establishment.
Through his wife?
Katherine Barton.
Oldest niece of Sir Frederick Barton.
She works at Shipley's.
Met Sator at an auction.
A happy marriage?
Practically estranged.
Well, how do I get to Sator?
Well, through her, of course.
You may have an inflated idea of my powers of seduction.
Hardly.
We have an ace in the hole.
You're carrying a Goya in a Harrods bag.
It's a fake by a Spaniard named Arepo.
One of two we've confiscated from an embezzler in Bern.
What happened to the other one?
It turned up at Shipley's.
Authenticated by Katherine Barton.
Put on auction.
And who do you think bought it?
Her husband?
Mmm-hmm.
Does she know it's a forgery?
Oh, it's hard to say.
Rumor has it that she and Arepo were close.
Uh-huh.
Look, no offense, but in this world, when someone is claiming to be a billionaire...
Brooks Brothers won't cut it.
I'm assuming I'm on a budget.
Save the world, then we'll balance the books.
Can I recommend a tailor?
I'll manage.
You British don't have a monopoly on snobbery, you know.
Well, not a monopoly.
More of a controlling interest.
Could you box that up for me?
Certainly not.
Goodbye, Sir Michael.
How can I help, sir?
Sorry, I wasn't notified of any appointments, Mr...
Goya.
Mr.
Goya.
No.
I'm told you're the person to see about Goya.
That's extraordinary.
What's it worth?
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
Lots of work to do before any kind of valuation.
Provenance, microscopic examination, X-rays.
But what does your heart tell you?
Sir, where did you say you acquired this drawing?
Tomas Arepo.
I bought my Goya for cents on a dollar from an irate Swiss banker.
Traced it back to Arepo, then realized I scored a bargain when he told me who paid top dollar for another one of his pictures.
Your drawing's an obvious fake.
My drawing's a very good fake.
You know that better than anyone.
The information's the bargain.
The information that I helped defraud my own husband?
He and I are in related businesses, but he's a very hard man to meet.
If you and I were to make an arrangement...
Arrangement?
You mean blackmail.
Don't be afraid of the word.
My husband isn't.
I'm sorry to tell you he got there first.
He knows?
And he's never done anything about it?
Why would he?
He paid $9 million for it.
Barely cover the cost of the holiday he just forced us on.
Where'd you go, Mars?
Vietnam, on our yacht.
His yacht.
You've got the suit.
The shoes, the watch.
Think you're a little out of your depth.
People who've amassed fortunes, like your husband's, generally aren't okay with being cheated out of any of it.
The drawing is his hold over me.
He threatened me with police.
Prison.
The works.
He controls me.
My contact with my son.
Everything.
Leaving would never have been easy but now it's impossible.
You can't fight.
Just beg.
In Vietnam, I tried to love him again.
Thought if there was love there, he might give me my son back.
We sat on that bloody boat watching the sunsets, in our lives.</i> He seemed happy, so I asked him.
He'd let me go if I agreed never to see my son again.
I expressed myself.
I took Max ashore.
He called us, contrite.
And when we got back, diving off the boat,</i> and he'd vanished.
I never felt such envy.
You don't seem the jealous type.
Of her freedom.
You know how I dream of just diving off that boat?
But you share a son.
That's my life now.
Did you know the drawing was a fake?
No.
Tomas and I became close, maybe too close.
I failed.
Andrei can't conceive of failure, only betrayal.
But I didn't betray my husband.
Retrospect, maybe I missed my chance.
And he let Arepo walk free.
If you'd actually met Arepo as you claimed, you'd understand he no longer walks anywhere.
We spoke on the phone.
He can't do that either.
Get me an introduction.
I'll take the drawing out of the equation.
No picture, no prosecution, no more hold over you.
I might just be your second chance.
No, I don't need redemption.
At betrayal.
Friends of your husband's?
You knew this was going to happen?
Don't worry, they won't kill you.
Andrei dislikes tangling with local law enforcement on that level.
You must've really not liked the look of me.
The look of you's fine.
It's best to get to the nasty part before I care one way or the other.
There's a number in your left coat pocket.
Don't call from home.
You won't be taking my call.
I might surprise you.
I ordered my hot sauce an hour ago.
Can we get going?
Please?
He wants you to see.
And he gets what he wants.
Not always, apparently.
to Pompeii</i> and see lava.
We will.
We'll go together.
I'll be there, too!
Told you I'd surprise you.
He's a cute kid.
He's everything.
Where's the drawing?
Oslo.
At the airport.
The airport?
Do you know what a Freeport is?
for art that was acquired...</i> built them.
I brought in the clients.</i> investments without importing them,</i> so they avoid paying tax.
It's sorta like a transit lounge for art?
Anything legal.
But it's not unlike the Swiss banking system.
Opaque.
As I'm sure you are aware, most Freeports are just warehouses.
But here we ensure that you can actually enjoy...
Rotas has assets in the Oslo Freeport.
I'm guessing it's there.
And this way to the vaults!
We make trips there four, five times a year.
Turns out art's of no importance to Andrei.
But the Freeports are.
The structure of the vaults is based on the Pentagon.
Each vault a separate structure within the others.
Damage to one structure won't compromise the others.
Some of our clients opt for biometric access, straight in...
off the tarmac.
From the terminal?
From their private planes.
Of course.
Our logistics department ships to and from any other Freeport in the world without customs inspection.
to find in there?</i> You really wanna know?
I'm not sure.
Bring some lead-lined gloves.
Jesus.
It's nuclear.
When you're on the tour, to the fire precautions.</i> Documents are vulnerable to...
Fire?
Absolutely!
No, I was going to say water damage from the sprinkler systems.
We don't use sprinklers.
The facility is flooded with halide gas, displacing all the air within seconds.
Can you show me?
If I did, we'd suffocate.
What about the staff?
Halide only fills the vaults, they just have to get into either corridor, and there is a 10-second warning.
At least you give them Well, sir, our clients use us because we have no priorities above their property.
Blimey.
All doors are fireproof.
Hydraulic closers, simple key and electronic triggers.
Surprisingly easy once there's a lockdown.
Why a lockdown?
Power switches to fail-safes, sealing the outer doors, but inner doors revert to factory settings.
And pickable locks.
Child's play?
They're inside airport security.
They have to worry about climate control, not armed raids.
So, how do we get enough firepower through the perimeter to trigger the lockdown procedure?
Back wall of the Freeport.
You've got something?
Not gonna like it.
You wanna crash a plane?
Well, not from the air.
Don't be so dramatic.
I want to run a jet off the taxiway and breach the rear wall and start a fire.
Well, how big a plane?
Well, that part is a little dramatic.
This is Mahir.
His team'll work the plane.
There can't be passengers.
Norsk Freight.
They use the hangar on the west side of the Freeport.
You want to crash a transport plane?
What about the crew?
We pop the slides, chuck 'em off.
On the move?
What's the problem?
They'll be fine.
Well, it seems bold.
Bold I'm fine with.
I thought you were gonna say nuts.
And if you get caught?
We won't.
And if you do?
Everyone assumes terrorism, but no one's died, so swift extradition then lost in the system.
It'll barely make the news.
Oh, depends on the size of your explosion.
Well, actually, the gold bars might get some play.
Gold bars?
Norsk Freight ships Treasury gold once a month.
Blow the back.
Drop it out on the runway.
No one will be looking at the building.
I guarantee you.
The space in the center of the pentagon is too big.
There's something there.
Can't figure it out, it's just not marked.
That's 45 seconds.
Ample.
Won't you be running?
All right, it's your turn.
Start packing.
Gentlemen, if you would, through the detector, please.
Sir?
Oh.
And, sir.
I can offer you, perhaps, a coffee, water?
No, I'll take an espresso.
Excellent.
Is everybody on this plane vegetarian?
Because all I got here is vegetarian.
So that looks like meat, but I think that looks vegetarian.
I think they both look vegetarian.
I don't really know.
It's confusing, ya know?
Okay.
This way, gentlemen.
Gentlemen, your assigned compartment.
Carry on.
Not the radio.
Let's go.
Uh...
Yoga.
Let's go!
Now!
Go, go, go!
Right.
Um...
You said 10 seconds, right?
There's someone in here with us.
Don't touch them!
The hell happened here?
It hasn't happened yet.
Don't kill him!
We need to know if we've been compromised.
Why are you here?
Who are you?
How'd you know we'd be here?
We need to go.
What happened to the other guy?
Took care of him.
Well, I've seen too much.
I'm still alive, which must mean you've decided to trust me.
Or maybe I lost my edge.
Edge is still intact.
There's a cold war.
Nuclear?
Temporal.
Time travel?
No.
Technology that can invert an object's entropy.
You mean reverse chronology.
Like Feynman and Wheeler's notion that a positron is an electron moving backwards in time?
Sure, that's exactly what I meant.
I have a master's in physics.
Well, try and keep up.
The implications of this are...
Beyond secret.
Then why'd you bring me in?
I thought we'd find a drawing and a couple boxes of bullets.
Not as surprised as I was.
I'm going back to Mumbai to get some answers.
I'll set you up as a go-between.
But remember, to you...
it's all about plutonium.
And when we're done, they'll kill you.
Won't you have to do that anyway?
I'd rather it be my decision.
So would I.
I think.
Your work?
What did you find in the vaults?
Two antagonists.
One inverted.
We took out the regular one, but the inverted one got away.
Both emerged at the same moment?
Yeah.
They were the same person.
Sator's built a turnstile in that vault.
Turnstile?
A machine for inverting.
You've told me that technology hasn't been invented yet.
It hasn't.
He's been given it by the future.
For what?
You have the best chance of finding out.
What if you have something he needs?
Such as?
Plutonium-241.
Sator tried to lift the only loose 241 from under a CIA team at the opera siege in Kiev.
He got the team.
Not the 241.
Who did?
Ukrainian Security Services.
It's moving to Tallinn in a week.
Helping an arms dealer steal weapons-grade plutonium is unacceptable, Priya.
I'm just gonna take him out.
No, no, no.
Sator has to stay alive.
He has to stay alive until we know his part in things.
Leverage the situation, without losing control of the 241.
It's too dangerous.
A terrorist's bomb, even one that can kill billions, is nothing compared with what will happen if we don't stop Sator.
From doing what?
We are being attacked by the future.
And Sator's helping.
You have to find out how.
I saw the news from Oslo.
Do you have the drawing?
You don't have to worry about it anymore.
You destroyed it?
I didn't think you'd want it back.
Does he know?
Not yet.
So sit tight.
Sit tight?
Every day my son spends with that monster, he thinks a little less of me.
It won't be long.
In the meantime, introduce me.
As what?
I'm a former first secretary from the American Embassy in Riyadh.
We met at a party last June.
We were at a party in Riyadh, but I don't think it was in June.
It was June 29th.
7:00 or 7:30.
Salmon was on the printed menu.
Swapped for sea bass on the night.
Sator left early.
That's when we met.
I came into Shipley's in London.
You ran into me here and wanna show me your yacht.
He'll think we're having an affair.
Then he'll wanna meet me.
Or have you killed.
Let me worry about that.
Did I look worried?
Sleeps 70 with crew.
Two helicopters.
Missile defenses.
Afraid of pirates?
Andrei lives playing one government off the other.
The day they turn, that's his refuge.
May I join you?
Not sure Volkov's taking passengers just now.
Then we'll take mine.
Max!
Who's the American?
He's a friend.
The man from Shipley's.
Who you tried to have beaten up.
I ask again, who is he?
We met in Riyadh last June at the American Embassy.
Good with fists for a diplomat.
Paranoia's your department, Andrei.
He seems nice.
I invited him to the dinner.
Max?
He's visiting Pompeii and Herculaneum.
You just sent him off?
I promised him I'd go with him.
I explained you were busy.
With your friend.
Hey, easy, fella.
Where I'm from, you buy me dinner first.
Just tell me if you've slept with my wife yet.
Uh...
No.
Not yet.
How would you like to die?
Old.
You chose the wrong profession.
There's a walled garden up the road.
We are going to take you there, cut your throat.
Not across.
In the middle, like a hole.
Then we take your balls and we stuff them in the cut, block the windpipe.
Complex.
It's very gratifying to watch a man you don't like try to pull his own balls out of his throat before he chokes.
Is this how you treat all your guests?
We're finished.
Do you like opera?
Well?
Not here.
You sail?
I've messed around on boats.
Be on the dock at 8:00 ready to do more than mess around.
too much school this year.</i> I'm taking him back to England.
The school won't be okay with him missing so much of the term.
You have all the trappings of a king.
We both know you're a grubby little man playing power games with a wife who doesn't love you anymore.
You seem...
spirited today.
Were you worried it had been destroyed?
Rest assured, instinct told me to remove it from the vault.
I've always had instincts about the future.
That's how I built this life you no longer value.
Sailing or diving?
Rising!
What do you know about opera?
In 2008, a remote Russian missile station was overwhelmed and held for a week.
When the station was retaken, quarters of a kilo lighter.
The missing 241 surfaced at the opera house siege in Kiev on the 14th.
Coming about!
What do you propose?
Partnership.
I wouldn't partner with you.
You can take care of yourself.
You have no record.
Someone in the arms trade, with training, who knows how to cover his tracks.
Not that shocking.
For an intelligence agent.
Right!
Burn in hell, Andrei.
You can't jibe a boat like this!
You can if you have to.
I need him.
What, to sell guns?
I'm not who you think I am.
Well, that I know.
He showed me the drawing.
I'm sorry.
I had to get close to him.
I don't know what you think your husband does...
Oh, we both know he's an arms dealer.
He's so much more.
What, then?
Andrei Sator holds all of our lives in his hands, not just yours.
Mr.
Sator wants to see you.
Okay.
Now.
Uh, he wants to see me without pants?
I'm not falling for it twice.
You have a better option?
Whatever it takes to get what you want.
Not a second's thought for me or my son.
What do you think he's gonna do to me now?
Try not to use it.
On anyone.
Enough.
See?
Pulse of a man half my age.
Drink with me.
It seems I now owe you my life.
It's nothing.
My life is not nothing.
And I don't like to be in debt.
Then pay me.
No retribution against your wife.
You think she released my harness?
It was my own mistake.
Then help me steal the 241.
I need resources.
It's weapons-grade plutonium.
That means special handling, containment facilities...
I know what it means.
You lecture me about radiation?
Andrei Sator, digging plutonium from the rubble of my city as a teenager.
Where?
One part of a warhead exploded at ground level, scattering the others.
They needed people to find the plutonium.
It became my first contract.
They thought it was a death sentence.</i> But...
of death...</i> for a life.
in the new Russia.</i> Even now, my company is the only one to operate in the ruins.
The 241 is being transported through northern Europe, on its way to the long-term nuclear storage depot in Trieste.
I'm told you have resources in Tallinn.
Stay with us tonight.
I insist.
What do you want?
We're going to talk about today.
No, we're not.
No?
We'll see.
Don't think for a second you can treat me like you treat your other women.
And, uh...
how do you imagine...
I treat these other women, huh?
You think I force them into conversation?
You wanna be quiet, fine.
You can bite down on that.
Even a soul as blank and brittle as yours needs a response.
Is fear and pain enough, Andrei?
That's all I have to offer you.
Well, that will have to do, then.
Why didn't you just let me go?
Because...
if I can't have you...
no one else can.
And if you touch me, I scream so loud he hears.
You think I let him interfere?
If he tried, you'd have to kill him.
End of deal.
So you leave me alone.
Not now!
Ninety-eight.
Not bad for such exertion.
He was at the window.
I was curious.
My property shouldn't concern you.
Who are you?
How do you come by your information about the opera?
You wouldn't do business with someone who wasn't savvy enough to be recruited.
Hell, the CIA provides two thirds of the market for fissile material.
They're usually buying, not selling.
But we do live in a twilight world.
Is that Whitman?
Pretty.
Next warning's a bullet in the brain.
No balls in my throat?
There will be no time for such things...
in Tallinn.
You make your way there.
I want Volkov on your team.
No.
I spring the material.
You pay me off.
Your wife does the exchange.
I never involve her in my business.
Yeah, that's why I trust her.
Put him ashore.
How do I contact you?
You don't.
How do you advance me the funds?
Handle the plutonium better than that.
no mold marks.
Nothing.</i> He buries his time capsule, transmits the location, then digs it up to collect the inverted materials they sent.
Seemingly instantaneous.
Where's he bury it?
Some place that won't be discovered for centuries.
What did the soil samples show?
Northern Europe, Asia.
Everything salvaged from Oslo's been shipped here.
Why am I here?
I don't trust anyone else to assess the pieces.
downtown, what's the thinking?</i> Crowded.
Unpredictable traffic patterns.
It's almost impossible to plan an ambush.
They have a point.
Is the convoy monitored from the air?
Tracked by GPS.
One wrong turn, in come the cavalry.
Guns that make the point without being fired.
We need a fast car that doesn't look fast.
Four heavy vehicles.
All different.
Bus, coach, 18-wheeler.
One of them has to be a fire truck.
Most of all, we have to set this up with nothing in the record.
Nothing electronic, nothing paper.
I don't want Sator ambushing us once we spring the material.
His ignorance is our only protection.
You see, Kat?
Some of my favorites.
Singed but, uh, salvageable, wouldn't you say?
You would never have anything to do with such things.
But this is where our worlds collide.
What is this, Andrei?
You know perfectly well what it is, Kat.
The filthy business that put those clothes on your back and our boy in his school, that you thought you could negotiate your way around.
Time to go.
I'm not going anywhere with him.
Look at me!
And understand, you don't negotiate with a tiger.
You admire a tiger until he turns on you and you feel its true fucking nature!
Don't.
You stay right there.
Green.
Two minutes.
You are not going to kill me.
I already tried.
You pushed me off a boat.
You are not going to shoot me in cold blood.
My blood's not cold, Andrei.
No, but you're not angry enough.
Because anger scars over into despair.
I look in your eyes...
I see despair.
Vengeful bitch!
Living off me!
Thinking that you're better!
Enough!
Tell me everything as it happens.
Seal me this side.
Yellow, 60 seconds.
Blue, 45 seconds.
Blue, 45, check.
Okay, Red.
Coming to you.
Watch everything.
Give me all the details.
All right, everyone set?
And five...
four...
three...
two...
Go, Yellow!
We got a problem!
Backup, we need backup!
Shit!
Check the radio chatter.
I've seen samples of encapsulation in every weapons class.
This is not one of them.
That's what he's after.
Can't understand this.
You said you spoke Estonian.
It's not Estonian.
It's backwards.
The hell is that?
Go, go, go!
Don't give it to him.
This isn't plutonium.
It's worse than that, God damn it!
Sorry.
He's getting away.
He left her in the car!
Go after her, go!
Go, go, go!
Pull up alongside!
Come on, come on.
Closer!
Keep it steady, keep it steady!
Hurry up!
Please!
All right, sit tight.
I'm calling the cavalry.
What cavalry?
If you are not telling the truth, she dies.
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
You left it in the car, not the fire truck, right?
is it really in the BMW?
I don't know.
Tell me or I'll shoot her again!
Leave her alone!
Kill him!
I don't have time to negotiate.
I can help you.
Please!
Next one's a bullet to the head.
Two.
Three.
Okay!
Okay.
The car.
The BMW.
I left it in the BMW.
We're going to check this is real.
It's in the glove box!
Where did you leave it?
Car or fire truck, which one?
Which vehicle did you leave it in?
I need to know before I go out there.
I already told you.
I believe you.
You wanted her here, I hope you'll be happy...
Clear!
Wheeler, go check the other side.
You two.
Where did he go?
The past.
It's in the glove box!
We're going to check this is real.
Next one's a bullet to the head.
Three.
I can help you.
I don't have time to negotiate.
Tell me or I'll shoot her again.
is it really in the BMW?
I don't know.
You left it in the car, not the fire truck, right?
Who told you that?
If you're not telling the truth, she dies.
I don't know what you're talking about.
She's been shot?
Bring her back, this side.
Was she shot with an inverted round?
This is Ives.
He's one of us.
Priya's.
Ours.
How did Sator know about the ambush?
It's posterity.
An ambush in the middle of the street can't stay out of the records.
Bullshit!
He knew every move we made!
Every one of 'em.
Somebody talked.
Who was it?
At every stage, you've known too much.
I'm going to ask you again.
Did you talk?
Nobody talked.
They're running a temporal pincer movement.
A what?
The pincer movement.
But not in space, in time.
Half his team moves forward through the event.
He monitors them, and then attacks at the end moving backwards, knowing everything.
Except for where I stashed the plutonium.
Which isn't really plutonium, is it?
I told you it was what he was after.
And you just told him where it was.
I lied.
Jesus.
You lied about it?
He couldn't verify inside the room.
He'd have shot her anyway.
Lying is standard operating procedure.
It's spread too far.
Meaning what?
She's gonna die.
Standard operating procedure.
Can't you help her?
Can we do something?
Can't we stabilize the inverse radiation by inverting the patient?
Takes days.
Let's go.
We took control of this machine minutes ago.
Before that, it's Sator's.
How long is she gonna live on this side?
Three hours, tops.
I'm taking her through.
I'm not gonna let her die.
I'll take my chances.
There's no way of bringing you back.
We find another machine.
A week ago?
Where?
Oslo.
That facility's inside an airport security perimeter.
It's impregnable.
Mmm...
It wasn't last week.
We're going in.
You might as well help us.
This is a proving window.
As you approach the turnstile, if you don't see yourself in the proving window, do not enter the machine.
Why not?
If you don't see yourself reverse-exit a machine, then you ain't getting out.
See for yourself.
There's your answer.
Let's go.
She's stabilizing slowly.
I'll clean and close, but the rest is time.
How long does she need?
Four, five days.
A week to be sure.
Hey, Neil.
Find a way to get us to Oslo.
I'm going back out there.
To do what?
To stop Sator from getting away with whatever it is I just gave him.
You didn't.
You lied about where it was.
Wait.
You're going out there for her.
He threatened to kill her in the past.
If he does, what happens to her here?
That's unknowable.
If you're there to make a change, you're not here to observe its effect.
What do you believe?
What's happened's happened.
We need to save her, here and now.
If you go back out there, you might hand him exactly what he's after.
Don't let them take her back through there.
Okay?
We can't stay here.
We don't have a lot of time.
So why don't you find us a nice, cozy shipping container that's just come off a ship from Oslo?
This is cowboy shit.
You have no idea what you're getting yourself into if you go through that door.
Well, I'm going, so any tips would be welcome.
Wheeler, brief him.
You'll need your own air.
Regular air won't pass through the membranes of inverted lungs.
Number one rule: don't come into contact with your forward self.
It's the whole point of these barriers and protective suits.
We don't have time.
Well, if your particles come into contact...
What?
Annihilation.
That would be bad, right?
When you exit the air lock, take a moment to orient yourself.
Things will feel strange.
When you run, the wind will be at your back.
You encounter fire, ice will form on your clothes as the transfer of heat is reversed.
Gravity will feel normal but appear reversed for the world around you.
You may experience distortions in your vision and hearing.
This is normal.
I can't vouch for the handling.
Friction and wind resistance are reversed.
You are inverted.
The world is not.
Was the transponder on the case?
We've tossed that case.
I'm moving backwards.
It's the ball I have to follow.
Give me the reader.
Okay.
You ready?
algorithm to the hypocenter.</i> I saw the handoff.
You made me shoot her for nothing.
You did get my pulse above 130, no one's done that before.
Not even my wife.
You left Ives and his team a hell of a cleanup.
Heat transfer was reversed.
You might be the first case of hypothermia from a gasoline explosion in history.
At this point, nothing surprises.
We're headed back to Oslo?
In a Rotas shipping container.
He's got the material, Neil.
I handed it to him on a plate.
I warned you...
What's happened's happened.
I get it now.
But it's hard to take things on trust from people speaking half-truths.
That's not fair.
You were a part of this before we met.
Were you working for Priya?
No.
Who recruited you, Neil?
It can't possibly do you any good to know that right now.
When this is over, if we're still standing, and you still care, then you can hear my life story, okay?
I'm sorry I involved you.
You need to tell me what's going on.
Apparently Neil here knows more about it than I do.
Good luck, pal.
By telling Kat anything, we're compromising her in Priya's eyes.
In Priya's eyes, she's already compromised.
She has the right to know why she might die.
Am I gonna die?
Not if we have something to say about it.
And we do.
Who are you?
Let's start with the simple stuff.
Every law of physics...
algorithm to the hypocenter.</i> You injured?
What's the algorithm, Neil?
One out of nine.
It's a formula rendered into physical form so it can't be copied or communicated.
It's a black box with one function.
Which is?
Inversion.
But not objects or peoples.
The world around us.
I don't understand.
As they invert the entropy of more and more objects, the two directions of time are becoming more intertwined.
But because the environment essentially flows in our direction...
we dominate.
They're always swimming upstream.
It's what saved your life.
Inverted explosion was pushing against the environment.
Pissing in the wind.
And the algorithm can change the direction of that wind.
It can invert the entropy of the world.
And if that happens?
Oh...
End of play.
a little more precise?
Everyone and everything that's ever lived, destroyed.
Instantly.
Precise enough?
Including my son.
The more you sleep, the faster you'll heal.
On a truck.
Shouldn't be long now.
I've been thinking.
We're their ancestors.
If they destroy us, won't that destroy them?
This brings us to the grandfather paradox.
The what?
If you went back in time and killed your own grandfather, how could you have been born to commit the act?
What's the answer?
There's no answer.
It's a paradox.
But in the future, those in power clearly believe that you can kick grandpa down the stairs, gouge his eyes out, slit his throat, without consequence.
Could they be right?
Doesn't matter.
They believe it.
So they're willing to destroy us.
Can I go back to sleep now?
No.
I thought of something else.
Great.
This reversing the flow of time.
Doesn't us being here now mean it never happens?
That we stop them?
Optimistically, I'd say that's right.
Pessimistically?
In a parallel worlds theory, we can't know the relationship between consciousness and multiple realities.
Does your head hurt yet?
Yes.
Try to sleep.
Shit.
They didn't take us inside.
What do we do?
We use the breach.
The chaos right after impact.
Get ready.
She healed enough?
I don't know.
I've never done this before.
The fire crew's there.
You take Kat through the breach, I take care of Sator's men and secure the vault.
Then you bring her in.
How's your arm?
Not good.
We move as soon as we hear the engines.
You're bleeding.
All right, let me take a look at it.
Ready?
Wait here.
I'm going in.
Come on!
Go, go, go!
Go!
You knew it was me coming out of that vault.
Why didn't you say?
That's a lot of explaining when someone's about to put a bullet in their own brain.
But afterwards?
Thing's the same, I knew you'd be okay.
What's happened's happened.
If I told you and you acted differently, who knows?
The policy is to suppress.
Whose policy?
Ours, my friend.
We're the people saving the world from what might've been.
Kat?
I'm here.
It'll be quite a scar.
You'll be okay.
Did it.
You did what?
Andrei has the algorithm.
You don't know where he is.
Or when.
If I don't do something, in two days, she tells me about the 241.
Nothing can change that.
We'll see.
Just get her here.
Hello, Priya.
What's going on?
Where's Neil?
Nursing Katherine Barton, who almost died because of you.
What did I do?
It's what you're going to do.
In two days, you're gonna have me dangle plutonium-241 in front of the world's most dangerous arms dealer.
Now, I wanna know why.
You let Sator get hold of 241?
No, I let him get ahold of the algorithm.
So, tell me about it, Priya.
It's...
It's unique.
The scientist who built it took her own life so she couldn't be forced to make another.
A scientist in the future?
Generations from now.
Why does she have to kill herself?
You're familiar with the Manhattan Project?
As they approached the first atomic test, Oppenheimer became concerned that the detonation might produce a chain reaction, engulfing the world.
They went ahead anyway and got lucky.
Think of our scientist as her generation's Oppenheimer.
She devises a method for inverting the world, but becomes convinced that by destroying us, they're destroying themselves.
The grandfather paradox.
But, unlike Oppenheimer, she rebels, splitting the algorithm into nine sections and hiding them the best place she can think of.
The past.
Here, now.
There are nine nuclear powers.
Nine bombs.
Nine sets of the most closely guarded materials in the history of the world.
The best hiding place possible.
Nuclear containment facilities.
Sator's lifelong mission, financed and guided by the future, has been to find and reassemble the algorithm.
Why do they choose him?
Because he was at the right place at the right time.
The collapse of the Soviet Union.
The most insecure moment in the history of nuclear weapons.
How many sections does he have?
After the 241, all nine.
Jesus Christ.
And that's why you're going to do things differently this time.
To change things?
So Katherine won't get hurt?
So Sator won't get the algorithm.
If that universe can exist...
we don't live in it.
Well, let's try.
You're going to warn me.
No, I'm not.
Ignorance is our ammunition.
Come on.
If you had known what the algorithm was, would you have let it fall into Sator's hands?
You want Sator to get the last section.
That is the only way he'll bring together the other eight.
I was supposed to steal it...
then lose it?
Mission accomplished.
You used me.
As you used Katherine.
Standard operating procedure.
You've done your part.
My part?
I'm the protagonist of this operation.
You...
are a protagonist.
Did you think you were the only one capable of saving the world?
No.
But I am.
Because I haven't told you where he's assembling the algorithm or when.
You're about to.
No, I'm not.
So, deal us in.
Why would you want to involve her again?
Because she can get close to him.
Does he still trust her?
He thinks she's dead.
But he used to.
You have started looking at the world in a new way.
And now, it's your turn.
Assuming she makes it out alive, whether or not you feel she knows too much.
I can't.
If you don't have the authority, then talk to whoever's in charge of loose ends.
I need your word that she and her son will be safe, Priya.
What good is someone's word in our line of business?
They'll be safe.
There's a rally point offshore at Trondheim.
ready to invert.</i> a turnstile?</i> The exact technology that we're trying to suppress.
Fighting fire with fire's a treacherous business.
But there are some people, in the future, who want to continue the algorithm's journey into the past.
You see...
in the past.</i> in the future.</i> Can't get over the birds.
How're you feeling?
Tell me you're gonna kill him.
I can't.
Why not?
Bet you've probably killed a lot of people.
Not with a dead man's switch.
The fitness tracker he wears.
He's obsessive about his health.
It'll be linked to a switch, probably a simple e-mail burst that reveals the location of the dead drop, set to fire if his heart stops.
His death activates the algorithm.
He dies, the world ends.
No one dares kill him.
No, you've missed the point.
He's intending to end his life.
Why?
He's dying.
Inoperable pancreatic cancer.
And he's taking the world with him.
If he can't have her, no one can.
He gets to choose the time and place for the end of the world.
What moment?
What does he choose?
You told me about a holiday where you let him feel loved.
Vietnam.
You said he vanished.
What day?
I went ashore with Max and he flew off, but I don't know what day it was.
It was the 14th.
Ten days ago.
He was in Ukraine.
At the Kiev opera siege.
How do you know about that?
The point is, he wasn't on his yacht, so that's his window.
To go back to that golden moment and have it be his last.
Everyone's last.
We have to lift the algorithm from the dead drop without Sator knowing.
If he believes it's there, he kills himself.
And not the rest of us.
Where's the dead drop?
Knowledge divided, my friend.
You're not gonna tell me?
Ignorance is our ammunition.
But I need you back on that yacht, Kat.
Why?
You have to stop him killing himself until we know the algorithm is out of the dead drop.
But if I'm caught there, my son sees.
I don't want those moments to be full of anguish if they're gonna be his last.
They're not.
It's time.
We're working our way back to the 14th, but without knowing where the dead drop is, there's only so much I can do to prepare.
You know what a hypocenter is?
It's ground zero for an underground nuclear test.
Sir Michael Crosby told me about a detonation in Stalsk-12 on the 14th.
The dead drop is at the bottom of the hypocenter.
That explosion seals up the algorithm.
Well, then we better pull it out of that hole before the bomb goes off, eh?
Where's Neil?
He must've gone through already.
I didn't get to say goodbye.
This is goodbye, isn't it?
I'd like to say...
that you don't have to do this, Kat...
Worst thing Andrei ever did to me was that offer he made me.
Let me go if I agreed never to see my son again.
I shouted and...
But he'd seen it on my face, just for an instant.
I considered it.
I don't know if I hate him more for what he's done, or because he knows that about me.
Oh.
A chance to help save my child.
You can't know what that means to a mother.
No.
You've killed people you've hated before.
It's not usually personal.
Well, he's dying anyway.
Maybe it doesn't even count.
It always counts, Kat.
You're not there to kill him, you're the backstop.
If we don't lift that algorithm and he kills himself, he takes us all with him.
You just keep up your end, okay?
Today's the 14th.
Offshore of Siberia.
Time for us to go.
You keep going back another day, give you some time to get back into Vietnam.
And who gets me on the yacht?
I've got somebody good lined up.
When it's over, when you're raising your boy, carry this.
There may be a time and place you feel threatened.
Hit "talk," state your location, hang up.
Who gets the message?
Posterity.
Stalsk-12.
Hidden from the world is a city where anything can happen.
And today, ladies and gents, for ten minutes, it most assuredly does.
You've been divided into two teams for a temporal pincer movement.
We're Red Team, moving forward.
In order to distinguish the teams, you'll wear these.
Our friends over there, Blue Team, led by Commander Wheeler, are inverted.
Why don't they let us see them?
Maybe we won't like what happened.
One hour from now, they had this briefing.
Then, were dropped on the ridge above the hypocenter, as close in time to the detonation as possible.
Their objectives were clearance and clarification.
Now, this briefing has the benefit of their experience.
Both teams have countdown watches.
Ours counts down from ten, from landing to zero to the explosion.
If you are not at the LZ at zero, you are not leaving.
Do you understand?
We drop in, clear LZs for Blue Team evacuation.
We make our way into the city proper.
These buildings are abandoned, but we learned there is a turnstile.
Expect a bitemporal response.
They'll have inverse ordnance?
Inverse, conventional, forward antagonists, inverted antagonists, they have it all.
On the other side of the city, the ground rises to the ridge above the hypocenter.
A splinter unit will take this tunnel from the city to the floor of the hypocenter.
Blue Team located an entrance here.
The bomb is in this rock, high above, to trigger a collapse, sealing the cavern.
How do we defuse the bomb up there?
We don't.
The explosion takes place as planned.
Now, our job is to fail to defuse that bomb while the splinter unit achieves its task undetected.
Which is?
Need-to-know, and you don't.
Any other stupid questions?
Good.
Well, let's go.
Let's get ready.
I wanted to be on the first wave.
There is no first wave.
Red Team and Blue Team operate simultaneously.
Look, don't get on the chopper if you can't stop thinking in linear terms.
Now, you wanna be on the team that lifts the contents of the capsule?
Absolutely.
Yeah, that's us.
We're splinter unit.
Just us?
No one who knows the contents of that capsule can leave the field.
I thought we'd manage ourselves.
It's 40 feet from the private deck to the water.
Can you jump it?
I can dive it.
Until you see my signal, you don't let him die.
Thirty seconds!
Go!
Go!
Go!
We're coming in on a shockwave.
Hang on, people.
On your feet!
There!
Ma'am.
We thought you'd gone ashore.
Well, I snuck back to surprise Andrei.
Oh, the boss left.
Well, have Mr.
Sator find me here.
And don't tell the others.
I'll get the mess.
Mines!
Mines!
They told me you'd gone ashore.
They told me you'd flown off.
I came back to see you and Max.
Max is on shore with Anna.
We need time, just you and me, after what happened.
I was joking.
It was a stupid joke.
You think I'm a terrible mother.
We both know my opinion of you is higher than yours of me.
I want things to be better, Andrei.
Take cover!
Get me a goddamn AT4!
Take him out, now!
Provide some cover!
Move, move, move!
Let's go!
Move, move, move!
Wheeler!
Get outta there!
Come on!
Ives!
Splinter unit.
Here.
You know, it's going to be a beautiful sunset.
I'll get Max brought back.
We should share the moment with him.
I'll make you a drink.
Bring my son back to the boat.
We're runnin' out of time, let's go!
If they see us, it's all for nothing.
We need a distraction.
Don't worry about that.
On my mark!
RPG, hit the base!
That building on my mark!
Three!
Two!
One!
Fire!
Fire!
Move!
Move!
We're committed now.
Come on.
What's that?
I borrowed it from the CIA.
What is it?
The way the world ends.
Not with a bang, but a whimper.
I don't understand.
When I take this, it's all over.
Then don't take it yet.
Why not?
Because we have the sunset coming.
And a little vodka left.
And Max will be here soon.
They said they thought it was you, not Anna, ashore with Max.
So long as you can tell the difference.
A moment's business, my love.
Copy that.
I repeat, not clear!

Neil!

Anything?
Nah, nothing.

They have no choice but to turn back.</i> We're responsible.
Knowing this, do you still want me to stop?
Yes.
Each generation looks out for its own survival.
That's exactly what they're doing.
Bringing death to all, because you have no life of your own left.
My greatest sin was to bring a son into a world I knew was ending.
Wait!
Wait!

Go!
Go!
You don't believe in God, or a future, or anything outside of your own experience.

Don't.

Enough business, my love.
You have no idea what I'm talking about, do you?
But it sounds terribly important.
Where are you going?
Aren't you hot?
What are you doing now?
I spilled sunscreen.
Just come here.
Turn over.
You'll like it.
I can't do this.
I'm not letting you go to your grave thinking we're coming with you.
You're dying alone, Andrei.
Come on, come on, come on!
Tunnel's sealed, gate's closed.
Mahir, do you copy?
Yeah.
Look in my eyes.
Which do you see?
Despair or anger?
I'm not the woman who could find love for you even though you scarred her on the inside.
I'm the vengeful bitch you scarred on the outside.
No!
Shit.
Ives, do you copy?
She's killed him.</i> She jumped the gun.
She killed him.
Come on, come on!
Do you think they made it?
Ah, screw it.
You jumped the gun!</i> I couldn't do it.
I couldn't let him die thinking he'd won.
I knew you'd find a way.
Wait, you found a way, we're okay, right?
Thought you were inverted.
Changed gears halfway.
Looked like you needed help here.
Here?
We needed help down there.
How'd you get that lock open?
Wasn't me.
Didn't your team need you?
I'll get 'em on the next pass.
All right, Ives?
Once I've caught my breath.
No one who's seen this leaves the field.
All right.
We hide it.
We end our lives.
That's the only way to be sure.
As to when...
maybe that's every man's decision to make for himself.
You're not gonna kill us?
If I ever find you, I will.
But you won't look too hard?
Yes, I will.
You're not going back to London to check on Kat, are you?
No.
It's far too dangerous.
Even from afar?
Even from afar.
Ives!
Wait.
Are you really going back in?
I'm the only one who could've got that door open in time, right, Ives?
Well, I don't know any locksmiths as good as you.
See?
It's me in there, again.
Weaving another past in the fabric of this mission.
Neil, wait!
Just saved the world.
Can't leave anything to chance.
But can we change things if we do it differently?
Which is an expression of faith in the mechanics of the world.
It's not an excuse to do nothing.
Fate?
Call it what you want.
What do you call it?
Reality.
Now let me go.
Hey, you never did tell me who recruited you, Neil.
Haven't you guessed by now?
You did.
Only not when you thought.
You have a future in the past.
Years ago for me.
Years from now for you.
You've known me for years?
For me, I think this is the end of a beautiful friendship.
But for me, it's just the beginning.
We get up to some stuff.

Five shares is plenty.
Six shares.
Don't forget the guy who planned the job.
He thinks he can sit it out and still take a slice.
I know why they call him the Joker.
So, why do they call him the Joker?
Yeah, to scare people.
You know, war paint.

I said, hands up, heads down!
Let's go, pal, I'm making a withdrawal here.

Funny, he told me something similar.
He what?

No!

If this Joker guy was so smart, he'd have had us bring a bigger car.

No, no, no, I kill the bus driver.
Bus driver?
What bus driver?
School's out.
Time to go.
That guy's not getting up, is he?
That's a lot of money.
What happened to the rest of the guys?
You think you're smart, huh?
The guy that hired youse...
Oh, criminals in this town used to believe in things.
Honor...
Look at you.
What do you believe in, huh?
What do you believe in?!
I believe whatever doesn't kill you simply makes you...
Mr.
Mayor, you were elected in a campaign to clean up the city.
Like this Batman.
We're hearing he's doing good, criminals are running scared.
You got more chance of winning the Powerball than running into him.
That's not true.
Our men in the Major Crimes Unit are close to an arrest.
Hey, Wuertz, mayor says you're closing in on the Batman.
The investigation is ongoing.
The process of cleaning up the streets is a long one.
I pledged in my campaign, uh, to have....
Ever intending to see your wife again, lieutenant?
I thought you had to go look after your mother, detective.
Checked her back into the hospital.
I'm sorry.
Hopefully...
That's why we bring dogs.
Please, they're crawling in my mouth.
Please, I beg you, get them off.
Look what your drugs do to my customers.
Buyer beware.
I told you my compound would take you places.
I never said they'd be places you wanted to go.
My business, repeat customers.
You don't like what I have to offer, you can buy from someone else.
Assuming Batman left anyone to buy from.
My dogs are hungry.
Pity there's only one of you.
Loose the dogs!
That's more like it.
Don't let me find you out here again.
Not my diagnosis.
What gives you the right?
What's the difference between you and me?
I'm not wearing hockey pads.

What's he hiding under that makeup?
Uh, can we get a minute, people, please?
Him again.
Who are the others?
Another bunch of smalltimers.
Some of the marked bills I gave you.
My detectives have been making drug buys with them.
This bank was another drop for the Mob.
That makes five.
We'd have to hit all banks simultaneously.
SWAT teams, backup.
What about this Joker guy?
One man or the entire Mob?
He can wait.
When the new DA hears about this, he'll want in.
I hear he's as stubborn as you are.

I'm the brains of the organization.
Carbon fiber, .28 caliber, made in China.
If you wanna kill a public servant, Mr.
Maroni, I recommend you buy American.
We'll never be able to link the gun to Maroni, so we can't charge him.
But they're trying to kill you, means we're getting to them.
I'm glad you're so pleased, Rachel.
I'm fine, by the way.
Come on, Harvey.
You're Gotham's DA.
You're not getting shot at, you're not doing your job right.
But, you know...
we could take the rest of the day off.
Can't.
I dragged the head of the Major Crimes Unit down here.
Oh, Jim Gordon?
He's a friend, actually.
Try to be nice.
I hear you got a hell of a right cross.
It's a shame Sal's going to walk.
Yeah, well, good thing about the Mob is they keep giving you second chances.
Lightly irradiated bills.
Fancy stuff for a city cop.
Have help?
We liaise with various agencies- - Save it, Gordon.
I wanna meet him.
Official policy is to arrest the vigilante known as Batman on sight.
Mm- hm.
What about that floodlight on the top of MCU?
If you got problems with malfunctioning equipment...
with Maintenance, counselor.
I've put every money launderer in Gotham behind bars...
is still getting its money out.
I think you and your friend have found the last game in town.
You're trying to hit them where it hurts, their wallets.
It's bold.
You gonna count me in?
In this town, the fewer people know something, the safer the operation.
I don't like that you got your own special unit...
I investigated at Internal Affairs.
If I didn't work with cops you'd investigated while at IA...
I don't get political points for being an idealist.
I do the best I can with what I have.
You want me to back warrants for search and seizure on five banks...
I can give you the names of the banks.
Well, that's a start.
I'll get you your warrants, but I want your trust.
Oh, you don't have to sell me, Dent.
We all know you're Gotham's white knight.
Yeah, well, I heard they have a different name for me down at MCU.
I wouldn't know about that.
In China, Lau Security Investments stands for dynamic new growth.
A joint Chinese venture with Wayne Enterprises will be a powerhouse.
Well, Mr.
Lau...
in expressing our own excitement.
Sir, I know Mr.
Wayne is curious about how his trust fund gets replenished...
You worry about the diligence, Mr.
Reese.
I'll worry about Bruce Wayne.
It's done.
The numbers are solid.
Do them again.
Wouldn't want the trust fund to run out, now, would we?
Another long night?
This joint venture was your idea, and the consultants love it.
But I'm not convinced.
Lau's company has grown by His revenue stream must be off the books...
Okay.
Cancel the deal.
You already knew.
Just needed a closer look at their books.
Anything else you can trouble me for?
I need a new suit.
Yeah.
Three buttons is a little '90s, Mr.
Wayne.
I'm not talking fashion, Mr.
Fox, so much as function.
You wanna be able to turn your head.
Sure make backing out of the driveway easier.
I'll see what I can do.
Took three weeks to get a reservation here.
I had to tell them I work for the government.
Rachel.
Fancy that.
Yeah, Bruce.
Fancy that.
Rachel, Natascha.
Natascha, Rachel.
Bruce.
This is Harvey Dent.
The famous Bruce Wayne.
Rachel's told me everything about you.
I certainly hope not.
Oh, they should.
I own the place.
How could you want to raise children in a city like this?
Well, I was raised here.
I turned out okay.
Is Wayne Manor in the city limits?
Is- - ?
Heh- heh.
The Palisades?
Sure.
You know, as our new DA, you might wanna figure out where your jurisdiction ends.
I'm talking about the kind of city that idolizes a masked vigilante.
Gotham City is proud of an ordinary citizen standing up for what's right.
Gotham needs heroes like you, elected officials, not a man who thinks he's above the law.
Exactly.
Who appointed the Batman?
We did.
All of us who stood by and let scum take control of our city.
But this is a democracy, Harvey.
When their enemies were at the gates...
suspend democracy and appoint one man to protect the city.
It wasn't considered an honor, it was a public service.
Harvey, the last man that they appointed to protect the republic was named Caesar...
You either die a hero...
to see yourself become the villain.
Whoever the Batman is, he doesn't wanna do this for the rest of his life.
How could he?
Batman is looking for someone to take up his mantle.
Someone like you, Mr.
Dent?
Maybe.
If I'm up to it.
What if Harvey Dent is the Caped Crusader?
Hm?
If I were sneaking out every night, someone would've noticed by now.
Well, I'm sold, Dent, and I'm gonna throw you a fundraiser.
That's nice, but I'm not up for reelection for three years.
No, you don't understand.
One fundraiser with my pals...
What the hell is this?
As you're all aware, one of our deposits was stolen.
A relatively small amount, 68 million.
Who's stupid enough to steal from us?
Two- bit wackjob, wears a cheap purple suit and makeup.
He's not the problem.
He's a nobody.
The problem is our money being tracked by the cops.
Thanks to Mr.
Maroni's well- placed sources...
identified our banks using marked bills...
seize your funds today.
And since the enthusiastic new DA has put all my competitors out of business...
Moving all deposits to one secure location, not a bank.
If the police were to gain leverage over one of you...
What stop them getting to you?
I go to Hong Kong, far from Dent's jurisdiction...
will not extradite one of their own.
How soon can you move the money?
I already have.
For obvious reasons, I couldn't wait for your permission.
Rest assured, your money is safe.
Oh, hee- hee, aha.
Ha, ooh, hee, ha- ha, ha- ha.
And I thought my jokes were bad.
Give me one reason why I shouldn't have my boy pull your head off.
How about a magic trick?
I'm gonna make this pencil disappear.
Ta- da!
It's- - It's gone.
Oh, and by the way, the suit, it wasn't cheap.
I want to hear proposition.
Let's wind the clocks back a year.
These cops and lawyers wouldn't dare cross any of you.
I mean, what happened?
Did your balls drop off?
Hm?
You see, a guy like me....
A guy like me- -  Look, listen.
I know why you choose to have your little....
sessions in broad daylight.
I know why you're afraid to go out at night.
The Batman.
See, Batman has shown Gotham your true colors, unfortunately.
Dent, he's just the beginning.
And as for the television's so- called plan...
He'll find him and make him squeal.
I know the squealers when I see them...
What do you propose?
It's simple.
We, uh, kill the Batman.
If it's so simple, why haven't you done it already?
If you're good at something, never do it for free.
How much you want?
Uh, half.
No, I'm not.
If we don't deal with this now...
able to get a nickel for his grandma.
Enough from the clown!
Ah, ta- ta- ta.
Let's not blow...
You think you can steal from us and just walk away?
I'm putting the word out.
Five hundred grand for this clown dead.
A million alive, so I can teach him some manners first.
All right.
So, listen, why don't you give me a call...
things a little more seriously?
Here's my card.
Mm- mm.
You're a hard man to reach.
Lau's halfway to Hong Kong.
If you'd have asked, I could have taken his passport.
All that was left in the vaults were marked bills.
They knew we were coming.
As soon as your office got involved- - My office?
You're sitting down there with scum like Wuertz and Ramirez and you're talking- - Oh, yeah.
I almost had your rookie cold on a racketeering beat.
Don't try and cloud the fact that clearly Maroni's got people in your office, Dent.
We need Lau back...
a national under any circumstances.
If I get him to you, can you get him to talk?
I'll get him to sing.
We're going after the Mob's life savings.
Things will get ugly.
I knew the risk when I took this job, lieutenant.
How will you get him back, any- - ?
He does that.
Our Chinese friends left town before I could tell them the deal was off.
Well, I'm sure that you've always wanted to go to Hong Kong.
What's wrong with a phone call?
I think Mr.
Lau deserves a more personal touch.
Now, for high-altitude jumps, you're going to need oxygen and stabilizers.
Well, I must say, compared to your usual requests...
is pretty straightforward.
What about getting back into the plane?
Now, that's more like it, Mr.
Wayne.
The CIA had a program back in the '60s...
out of hot spots called Sky Hook.
Okay.
Now....
Hardened Kevlar plates over titanium-dipped tri-weave fibers for flexibility.
You'll be lighter, faster, more agile.
Perhaps you should read the instructions first?
Separation of the plates makes you more vulnerable to knives and gunfire.
We wouldn't wanna make things too easy, now, would we?
How will it hold up against dogs?
We talking rottweilers or Chihuahuas?
Should do fine against cats.
I found one in Arizona.
A very nice man said he could have it up and running in a week, and he takes cash.
They run flights into Pyongyang, below radar.
I believe this is your plane, sir.
You look tired, Alfred.
You'll be all right without me?
If you can tell me the Russian for Yo, Gambol, somebody here for you.
They say they've just killed the Joker.
They brought the body.
So, dead, that's 500.
How about alive?
Hm?
You wanna know how I got these scars?
My father was...
And one night, he goes off crazier than usual.
Mommy gets the kitchen knife to defend herself.
He doesn't like that...
So, me watching...
laughing while he does it.
He turns to me and he says: He comes at me with the knife.
He sticks the blade in my mouth.
And....
Why so serious?
Now...
So which of you fine gentlemen would like to join our team?
Oh.
There's only one spot open right now, so we're gonna have...
Make it fast.
Welcome to Hong Kong, Mr.
Fox.
Mr.
Lau regrets he is unable to greet you in person today.
I understand.
For security purposes, I'm gonna have to ask you to check in your mobile.
Of course.
I must apologize for leaving Gotham in the middle of our negotiations.
This misunderstanding with the Gotham police force...
A businessman of your stature will understand and...
Well, I do appreciate you bringing me out here in such style, Mr.
Lau, but I re- - We do not allow cell phones in here.
I'm sorry.
Forgot I had it.
No, I really came to tell you that our business deal has to be put on hold.
You see, we can't afford to be seen to do business with...
I'm sure a businessman of your stature will understand.
I think, Mr.
Fox, a simple phone call might have sufficed.
Mr.
Wayne didn't want you to think he was deliberately wasting your time.
Just accidentally wasting it.
That's very good, Mr.
Lau.
Hey, sir.
There's a better view from the peak tram.
How's the view from LSI Holdings?
Restricted.
Lau is holed up in there good and tight.
Sends out a high- frequency pulse...
for mapping an environment.
Sonar.
Just like a....
Submarine, Mr.
Wayne.
Like a submarine.
Mr.
Wayne?
Good luck.
Look, give us the money and we'll talk about making a deal.
The money is the only reason I'm still alive.
Oh, you mean, when they find out that you've helped us, they're gonna kill you?
I'm just assuming your client's cooperation with this investigation.
As will everyone.
No?
Okay.
Enjoy your time in County, Mr.
Lau.
Wait!
I won't give you the money...
all of them.
You were a glorified accountant.
What could you possibly have on all of them that we could charge?
I'm good with calculation.
I handled all their investments.
One big pot.
Got it.
One minute.
RICO.
If they pooled their money, we can charge them as one criminal conspiracy.
Charge them with what?
In a RICO case, if you can charge one of them with a felony- - You can charge all of them with it.
That's great.
Mr.
Lau.
What kind of details do you have about this communal fund?
I'm just curious.
With all your clients locked up...
with all that money?
Like I said, I'm good with calculation.
He can't go to County.
I'll keep him here in the holding cells.
What is this, Gordon, your fortress?
Well, you trust them over at County?
I don't trust them here.
Lau stays.
Well, I don't know about Mr.
Lau's travel arrangements, but I'm sure glad he's back.
Put word out.
We hire the clown.
He was right.
We have to fix real problem.
Batman.
You sure you wanna embarrass me in front of my friends?
Oh, don't worry.
They're coming too.
Have a nice trip.
See you next fall.
Seven hundred twelve counts of extortion.
Eight hundred and forty nine counts of racketeering.
Two hundred and forty six counts of fraud.
Eighty seven counts of conspiracy murder.
Five hundred and twenty- seven counts of obstruction of justice.
How do the defendants plead?
Order in the court.
Five hundred and forty nine criminals at once.
How did you convince Surrillo to hear this farce?
She shares my enthusiasm for justice.
After all, she is a judge.
Even if you blow enough smoke to get convictions out of Surrillo...
a new record at appeals.
It won't matter.
The head guys make bail, sure.
But the midlevel guys, they can't.
They can't afford to be off the streets.
They'll cut deals that include some jail time.
Think of all you could do with 18 months of clean streets.
Sit down.
The public likes you.
That's the only reason that this might fly.
But that means it's on you.
They're all gonna come after you now, and not just the Mob.
Politicians, journalists, cops.
Anyone whose wallet's about to get lighter.
Are you up to it?
You'd better be.
Because they get anything on you...
streets, followed swiftly by you and me.
Jesus!
I think your fundraiser will be a great success, sir.
And why do you think I wanna hold a party for Harvey Dent?
I assumed it was your usual reason for socializing beyond myself...
To try to impress Miss Dawes.
Very droll, but very wrong.
Actually, it's Dent.
Police released video footage found concealed on the body.
Sensitive viewers, be aware.
The image is disturbing.
Tell them your name.
Brian Douglas.
And are you the real Batman?
Then why do you dress up like him?
Whoo- hoo- hoo- hoo!
Because he's a symbol that we don't have to be afraid of scum like you.
Yeah.
You do, Brian.
You really do.
Huh?
Yeah.
Oh, shh, shh, shh.
So you think Batman's made Gotham a better place?
Hm?
Look at me.
Look at me!
You see, this is how crazy Batman's made Gotham.
You want order in Gotham...
and turn himself in.
Oh, and every day he doesn't, people will die.
Starting tonight.
I'm a man of my word.
Harvey Dent, scourge of the underworld...
A little liquid courage, Mr.
Dent?
Rachel talks about you all the time.
You've known her her whole life.
Not yet, sir.
Any psychotic ex-boyfriends I should be aware of?
Oh, you have no idea.
I'm sorry that I'm late.
I'm glad to see that you all got started without me.
Now, where is Harvey?
Where- - ?
Harvey Dent, the man of the hour.
Where's Rachel Dawes?
She is my oldest friend.
Come here.
When Rachel first told me she was dating Harvey Dent, I had one thing to say: campaign commercials? Yeah, nice slogan, Harvey.
But it caught Rachel's attention.
And then I started to pay attention to Harvey...
as our new DA.
And you know what?
I believe in Harvey Dent.
I believe that on his watch, Gotham can feel...
Look at this face.
This is the face of Gotham's bright future.
To Harvey Dent.
Let's hear it for him.
Harvey.
Harvey may not know you well enough to understand you're making fun of him...
You know that day that you once told me about...
need Batman?
He locked up half of the city's criminals, and he did it without wearing a mask.
Gotham needs a hero with a face.
You can throw a party, Wayne, I'll give you that.
Thanks again.
You mind if I borrow Rachel?
Lieutenant, that joker card pinned to the body?
Forensics found three sets of DNA.
The DNA belongs to Judge Surrillo, Harvey Dent and Commissioner Loeb.
The Joker's telling us who he's targeting.
Get a unit over to Surrillo's house.
Tell Wuertz to find Dent.
Protective custody.
Where's the commissioner?
Gordon.
What are you up to?
We're secure.
I want a floor- by- floor search of the entire building.
We believe the Joker's made a threat against your life.
These are dangerous people.
You're not giving me a lot of information.
Even we don't know where you're going.
Take the envelope, get in, open it.
It'll tell you where you're headed.
You can't leave me alone with these people.
The whole Mob's after you and you're worried about these guys?
Compared to this, the Mob doesn't scare me.
Gordon, you're unlikely to discover this for yourself, so...
commissioner earns a lot of threats.
I found the appropriate response to these situations a long time ago.
Them gunning for you makes you see things clearly.
Yeah, I bet.
Yeah.
It makes you think about things you couldn't stand losing...
spend your life with.
You get to explain to my wife...
Sir, the joker card had traces of your DNA on it.
What's your answer?
I don't have an answer.
How'd they get my DNA?
Somebody with access to your office or house...
or a glass- -  Wait!
Wait!
Just tell me it's not Wayne.
The guy's a complete f- - What are you doing?
Oh, shit.
Get a medic!
They've come for him.
We made it.
Stay hidden.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
We are tonight's entertainment.
I only have one question: Where is Harvey Dent?
You know where Harvey is?
You know who he is?
Hands up, pretty boy.
Do you know where I can find Harvey?
I need to talk to him.
Just something little, huh?
No.
What's going on out there?
Wayne!
Hey, wait- - Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
You know, I'll settle for his loved ones.
We're not intimidated by thugs.
You know...
I hated my father.
Okay, stop.
Well, hello, beautiful.
You must be Harvey's squeeze.
Hm?
And you are beautiful.
You look nervous.
Is it the scars?
You wanna know how I got them?
Come here.
Hey.
Look at me.
So I had a wife.
She was beautiful, like you...
with the sharks.
Hey.
One day they carve her face.
And we have no money for surgeries.
She can't take it.
I just wanna see her smile again.
Hm?
I just want her to know that I don't care about the scars.
So...
and do this...
And you know what?
She can't stand the sight of me.
She leaves.
Now I see the funny side.
Now I'm always smiling.
You got a little fight in you.
I like that.
Then you're gonna love me.
Drop the gun.
Oh, sure.
You just take off your little mask and show us all who you really are.
Hm?
Let her go.
Very poor choice of words.
Are you all right?
Let's not do that again.
Thank you.
Jim, it's over.
As long as they don't get to Lau, we've cut off their funds.
The prosecution's over.
Nobody's standing up in front of a judge...
commissioners are getting blown away.
So where do you keep your trash?
You're due in court.
I need you alive long enough to get you on the record.
You can't protect me.
You can't even protect yourselves.
You refuse to cooperate, you're not coming back here, you go to County.
How long do you calculate you'll last in there?
Targeting me won't get their money.
I knew the Mob wouldn't go down easily...
You squeezed them, you hammered them to the point of desperation.
And in their desperation, they turned to a man they didn't fully understand.
Criminals aren't complicated, Alfred.
We just need to figure out what he's after.
With respect, Master Wayne...
you don't fully understand either.
A long time ago, I was in Burma...
for the local government.
They were trying to buy the loyalty of tribal leaders...
in a forest north of Rangoon by a bandit.
So we went looking for the stones.
But in six months, we never met anyone who traded with him.
One day, I saw a child playing with a ruby...
The bandit had been throwing them away.
Because some men aren't looking for anything logical, like money.
They can't be bought, bullied, reasoned or negotiated with.
Some men just wanna watch the world burn.
Your name, sir?
Eighth and Orchard.
You'll find Harvey Dent there.
Check the names.
Harvey Dent.
I need 10 minutes with the scene before your men contaminate it.
Give us a minute, guys.
That's brick underneath.
Fingerprints.
Whatever you're gonna do, do it fast.
Because we found his next target.
He's put it in tomorrow's paper.
I'm not sure you made it loud enough, sir.
What can I do for you, Mr.
Reese?
You wanted me to do the diligence on the LSI Holdings deal again.
Well, I found some irregularities.
Their CEO is in police custody.
No, not with their numbers, with yours.
Applied Sciences.
Whole division of Wayne Enterprises just disappeared overnight.
I went down to the archives and I started pulling some old files.
Don't tell me you didn't recognize your baby pancaking cop cars on the evening news.
Now you got the entire R & D Department burning through cash...
cell phones for the Army?
What are you building for him now, a rocket ship?
I want...
for the rest of my life.
Let me get this straight.
You think that your client...
most powerful men in the world, is secretly a vigilante...
criminals to a pulp with his bare hands...
is to blackmail this person?
Good luck.
When- - Keep that.
This is your original scan.
Here it is reengineered.
And there's the thumbprint he left when he pushed the round in the clip.
I'll get you a copy.
Mr.
Wayne, did you reassign R & D?
Yeah.
Government telecommunications project.
Wasn't aware we had any government contracts.
You know, Lucius, I'm playing this one pretty close to the chest.
Fair enough.
With no word from the Batman, even as they mourn Commissioner Loeb...
the Joker will make good on his threat...
The Gotham Times to kill the mayor.
I've checked all the databases.
There are four possibles.
Cross- reference the addresses.
Look for Parkside, overlooking the parade.
I got one.
Melvin White, Aggravated assault, moved to Arkham twice.
What do you got on the roof?
We're tight, but frankly, there's a lot of windows up here.
Commissioner Loeb dedicated his life to law enforcement...
of his community.
I remember when I first took office...
to stay on as commissioner.
And he said he would, provided I kept my politics out of his office.
Clearly he was not a man who minced words, nor should he have been.
A number of policies that he enacted as commissioner were unpopular.
Policies that flooded my office with angry calls and letters....
They took our guns.
And our uniforms.
And as we recognize the sacrifice of this man...
is the price of safety.
Stand by.
Honor guard.
Attention.
Port arms.
Ready!
Aim!
Fire!
Ready!
Aim!
Ready!
Aim!
Stay down!
Don't move!
Mr.
Mayor.
Get him out of here.
Get out of here.
Tell me what you know about the Joker.
No.
I'm sorry, Barbara.
Jimmy, go play with your sister.
Go ahead, honey.
If there's anything we can do, anything you need, we're here for you.
Shh.
Are you out there?
Are you?
You brought this craziness on us.
You did!
You brought this on us!
Switch it off, he ain't coming.
He doesn't wanna talk to us.
God help whoever he does wanna talk to.
Can't we go someplace quieter?
We can't hear each other talk.
What makes you think I wanna hear you talk?
What?
Okay.
I'm where you should be, at Major Crimes.
I'm trying to deal with all of this mess.
The Joker's named you next.
God, is there someone, is there anyone in this town we can trust?
Bruce.
We can trust Bruce Wayne.
Bruce's penthouse is now the safest place in the city.
Then you go straight there.
Don't tell anybody and I'll find you there.
I love you.
I want the Joker.
From one professional to another...
pick a better spot.
From this height, the fall wouldn't kill me.
He must have friends.
Friends?
Have you met this guy?
Someone knows where he is.
Nobody's gonna tell you nothing.
They're wise to your act.
You got rules.
The Joker, he's got no rules.
Nobody's gonna cross him for you.
If you want this guy, you got one way.
But you already know what that is.
Just take off that mask, let him come find you.
Or you can let a couple more people get killed while you make up your mind.
You wanna play games?
How's that feel?
No.
No, I wouldn't.
That's why I'm not gonna leave it up to me.
Heads, you get to keep your head.
Tails...
So, you wanna tell me about the Joker?
You're not playing the odds, friend.
Let's do it again.
You'd leave a man's life to chance?
He's a paranoid schizophrenic, former patient at Arkham.
The kind of mind the Joker attracts.
What do you expect to learn from him?
The Joker killed Gordon.
He's gonna kill Rachel.
You're the symbol of hope I could never be.
Your stand against organized crime...
in Gotham in decades.
If anyone saw this, everything would be undone.
The criminals you arrested would be released...
will have died for nothing.
You're gonna hold a press conference tomorrow.
Gotham's in your hands now.
You can't.
You can't give in.
You can't give in!
Harvey called.
He said Batman's gonna turn himself in.
I have no choice.
You honestly think that's gonna keep the Joker from killing people?
Maybe not.
But I have enough blood on my hands.
And I've seen now what I would have to become to stop men like him.
You once told me that if the day came when I was finished...
Bruce, don't make me your one hope for a normal life.
Did you mean it?
Yes.
Bruce.
If you turn yourself in, they're not gonna let us be together.
Anything that could lead back to Lucius or Rachel.
People are dying, Alfred.
What would you have me do?
Endure, Master Wayne.
Take it.
They'll hate you for it, but that's the point of Batman.
He can be the outcast.
He can make the choice that no one else can make.
The right choice.
No, today I found out what Batman can't do.
He can't endure this.
Today you get to say I told you so. Today, I don't want to.
But I did bloody tell you.
I suppose they're gonna lock me up as well...
Accomplice?
I'm gonna tell them the whole thing was your idea.
Ladies and gentlemen, I've called this press conference for two reasons.
Firstly, to assure the citizens of Gotham...
over the Joker killings is being done.
Secondly, because the Batman has offered to turn himself in.
But let's consider the situation.
Should we give in to this terrorist's demands?
Do we really think he's gonna- - ?
You'd rather protect an outlaw vigilante than the lives of citizens?
The Batman is an outlaw.
That's not why we demand he turn himself in, we're doing it because we're scared.
We've been happy to let Batman clean up our streets till now.
Yes, they are.
But the night is darkest just before the dawn.
And I promise you...
One day, the Batman will have to answer for the laws he's broken.
But to us...
He should turn himself in!
So be it.
Take the Batman into custody.
I am the Batman.
Alfred.
Why is he letting Harvey do this?
Perhaps both Bruce and Mr.
Dent...
something more important...
Miss Dawes...
That's the sacrifice he's making.
He's not being a hero.
He's being something more.
Yeah, you're absolutely right.
Letting Harvey take the fall for this is not heroic at all.
You know him better than anyone.
I do.
Will you give this to him for me?
When the time is right?
How will I know?
It's not sealed.
Goodbye, Alfred.
Bye, Rachel.
I didn't have time to talk this through.
This is the Joker's chance, and when he attacks, the Batman will take him down.
Listen.
This is too dangerous.
We get this guy to County, he's their problem.
The streets will be cleared...
The convoys stop for no reason.
I hope you got some moves, pal.
He's using you as bait.
He doesn't know if he can get the Joker.
He's failed so far.
What about the people depending on you to clean the city up and do it honorably and- - ?
Harvey.
Tell everyone the truth.
Heads, I go through with it.
This is your life.
You can't leave something like that to chance.
I'm not.
You make your own luck.
Hey, you wait like everybody else, pal.
What the hell is that?
Obstruction ahead, obstruction ahead!
Damn it!
All units divert down onto Lower Fifth.
I repeat, exit down.
Exit down!
Lower Fifth?
We'll be like turkeys on Thanksgiving.
Jesus.
Come on, get us out of here.
Let's go.
Listen, we need backup.
We've got company.
We got trouble, guys.
Lock and load!
What the hell was that?
What is that?
What is that, a bazooka?
I didn't sign up for this!
Look out.
Look out!
Hmm.
Come on, let's go!
Harvey, Harvey, Harvey Dent.
Oh, excuse me.
I wanna drive.
Scanning all systems.
Scanning all systems.
We gotta get topside.
We need air support, now!
I like this job.
I like it.
Damage catastrophic.
Eject sequence initiated.
Goodbye.
We're on point, ready to give them some of their own medicine.
That's what I'm talking about.
Air cav.
Okay, rack them up.
Rack them up, rack them up, rack them up.
That's not good.
Okay, that's not good!
Now, there's a Batman.
Ooh, you wanna play.
Come on.
Come on.
He missed!
You can't stop here.
We're like sitting ducks!
Come on, come on.
Come on.
Come on.
I want you to do it, I want you to do it.
Come on!
Come on.
Come on.
I want you to do it, I want you to do it.
Come on, hit me.
Come on, hit me.
Come on, hit me!
Hit me!
Come on, come on.
Aah!
Could you please just give me a minute?
We got you, you son of a bitch.
Gor- -  You do like to play things pretty close to the chest.
We got him, Harvey.
Mr.
Dent!
How does it feel to be the biggest hero in Gotham?
No, I'm no hero.
Gotham's finest, they're the heroes.
But you and your office have been working with the Batman all along.
Saving my ass.
All right, people, that's enough.
Let him be.
Let him be.
Thank you, detective.
I've got a date with a pretty upset girlfriend.
Stand away!
All of you!
I don't want anything for his Mob lawyer to use, you understand?
Back from the dead.
I, uh...
What do we got?
Nothing.
No matches on prints, DNA, dental.
Clothing is custom, no labels.
Nothing in his pockets but knives and lint.
No name.
The clown'll keep till morning.
Go get some rest.
You're gonna need it.
Tomorrow you take the big job.
You don't have any say in the matter.
Commissioner Gordon.
I'm sorry, I couldn't risk your safety.
Look at these ugly bastards.
You're lucky to be feeling anything below the neck.
My insides hurt.
Did Batman save you, Daddy?
Actually, this time...
Has he said anything yet?
Evening, commissioner.
Harvey Dent never made it home.
Me?
I was right here.
Who did you leave him with?
Hm?
Your people?
Assuming, of course, that they are still your people...
Does it depress you, commissioner...
Does it make you feel responsible for Harvey Dent's current predicament?
What difference does that make?
Well, depending on the time, he may be in one spot or several.
Ah, the good cop, bad cop routine?
Not exactly.
Never start with the head.
The victim gets all fuzzy.
He can't feel the next- - See?
You wanted me.
Here I am.
I wanted to see what you'd do.
And you didn't disappoint.
You let five people die.
Then you let Dent take your place.
Those Mob fools want you gone so they can get back to the way things were.
But I know the truth.
There's no going back.
You've changed things.
I don't wanna kill you.
What would I do without you?
Go back to ripping off Mob dealers?
No, no.
No.
No, you....
You complete me.
Even if you'd like to be.
To them, you're just a freak...
They need you right now...
You see, their morals, their code...
Dropped at the first sign of trouble.
They're only as good as the world allows them to be.
I'll show you.
When the chips are down, these- - These civilized people...
See, I'm not a monster.
I'm just ahead of the curve.
Where's Dent?
You have all these rules, and you think they'll save you.
Oh.
Then that's the rule you'll have to break to know the truth.
Which is?
The only sensible way to live is without rules.
And tonight you're gonna break your one rule.
I'm considering it.
There's only minutes left, so you'll have to play my game...
You know, for a while there, I thought you really were Dent.
The way you threw yourself after her.
Look at you go.
Does Harvey know about you and his little bunny?
Where are they?
Killing is making a choice.
Your friend the district attorney, or his blushing bride- to- be.
You have nothing, nothing to threaten me with.
Nothing to do with all your strength.
Don't worry, I'm gonna tell you where they are, both of them.
And that's the point.
You'll have to choose.
He's at 250 52nd Street...
We're getting Dent!
Hello?
Can anybody hear me?
Hello!
Oh, Harvey, thank God.
Are you okay?
I'm all right.
I'm in a- - I'm in a warehouse.
They got me wired to these oil drums.
I am too.
Harvey.
I want my phone call.
I want it.
I want it.
I want my phone call.
That's nice.
How many of your friends have I killed?
I'm a 20 year man...
punks who need a lesson in manners...
who would just enjoy it.
And you killed six of my friends.
Six?
Please.
My insides hurt.
I don't really care.
Back away.
The boss said he'd make the voices go away.
He said he'd go inside and replace them with bright lights...
You're out of your mind, pal.
Back off.
Medic to the holding tank.
Come on.
Get the door open.
You guys, back off!
Listen, we don't have a lot of time.
They told me that only one of us was gonna make it...
let our friends choose.
Okay, Rachel.
It's gonna be fine.
It's gonna be all right.
They're coming for you.
Listen to me.
I'll help you.
Just talk me through what's going on with you.
Harvey?
Harvey, what's happening?
All available units, converge at 250 52nd Street.
Do you wanna know why I use a knife?
Guns are too quick.
You can't savor all the...
You see, in their last moments...
So in a way, I knew your friends better than you ever did.
Would you like to know which of them were cowards?
What's that?
Jeez.
He's got some kind of a...
I'm gonna have to try and enjoy it even more.
Whoa, whoa!
Just put it down.
Take it easy.
Take it easy.
Drop the weapon now!
I just want my phone call.
What- - ?
What- - ?
What's happening?
Just talk to me, just for one second.
Ow.
Is that a phone?
Mount the curb!
Harvey, just in case, I wanna tell you something, okay?
Don't think like that.
They're coming.
I know they are, but I don't want them to.
I don't wanna live without you, and I do have an answer for you.
My answer is yes.
No!
No!
No!
Not me!
Why are you coming for me?
No!
Rachel!
Rachel!
Okay.
Rachel!
No!
No!
Harvey, it's okay.
It's all right.
Listen.
Somewh- - No, commissioner!
Rachel!
No!
Hello there.
Back at the MCU, the Joker's gone.
With Lau?
The Joker planned to be caught.
He wanted me to lock him up in the MCU.
Dear I need to be honest and clear.
I'm going to marry Harvey Dent.
I love him, and I wanna spend the rest of my life with him.
When I told you that if Gotham no longer needed Batman, we could be together...
But now I'm sure the day won't come when you no longer need Batman.
I hope it does.
And if it does, I will be there...
I'm sorry, Harvey.
I'm sorry to let you down.
If you lose your faith in me, please keep your faith in people.
Love, now and always, Rachel.
Prepared a little breakfast.
Yes, Master Wayne?
Did I bring this on her?
I was meant to inspire good...
You have inspired good.
But you spat in the faces of Gotham's criminals.
Didn't you think there might be casualties?
Things always get worse before they get better.
But Rachel, Alfred.
Rachel believed in what you stood for...
Gotham needs you.
No, Gotham needs its true hero...
blow him half to hell.
Which is why, for now...
make do with you.
She was gonna wait for me, Alfred.
Dent doesn't know.
He can never know.
What's that?
How?
We burned the forest down.
He's credible, an M & A lawyer from a leading consultancy.
He says he's waited as long as he can for Batman to do the right thing.
Now he's taking matters into his own hands.
We'll be live at 5 with the true identity of the Batman.
I'm sorry about Rachel.
The doctor says you're in agonizing pain, but that you won't accept medication.
That you're refusing to...
Remember that name...
What was it, Gordon?
Harvey, I....
Say it.
Say it!
Two-Face.
Harvey Two-Face.
Why should I hide who I am?
I know you tried to warn me.
I'm sorry.
Wuertz picked you up.
Was he working for them?
Do you know who picked up Rachel?
Harvey, I need to know which of my men I can trust.
Why would you listen to me now?
I'm sorry, Harvey.
No.
No, you're not.
Not yet.
This craziness, it's too much.
Should've thought about that before you let the clown out of the box.
You want him?
I can tell you where he'll be this afternoon.
Not so crazy as you look.
I told you, I'm a man of my word.
Where is the Italian?
All tactical units will converge on the location in 20 minutes.
I want auxiliary units to cover all possible getaway routes.
Please.
Joker- man, what you do with all your money?
You see, I'm a guy of simple taste.
I enjoy...
And you know the thing that they have in common?
They're cheap.
How much are they paying you to say who Batman is?
This is our chance.
I want Lau alive.
The Joker, either way.
Hey, Jim.
Get a load of this.
Let's take the next caller.
Harvey Dent didn't wanna give in to this maniac.
You think you know better?
I think that if we could talk to Dent today,he may feel differently.
And we wish him a speedy recovery.
Because God knows, we need him now.
You said you were a man of your word.
Oh, I am.
I'm only burning my half.
All you care about is money.
This town deserves a better class of criminal...
Tell your men they work for me now.
This is my city.
They won't work for a freak.
Why don't we cut you up into little pieces...
And then we'll see how loyal a hungry dog really is.
It's not about money...
Everything burns.
The Mob ground out a little profit...
one block at a time.
And it was so boring.
I've had a change of heart.
I don't want Mr.
Reese spoiling everything...
Let's give someone else a chance.
If Coleman Reese isn't dead in 60 minutes...
Call in every officer.
Tell them to head to their nearest hospital and start evac and search.
Call the transit authority, school board, prisons.
Get every bus down to a hospital.
The priority is Gotham General.
Wheel everybody out of that place right now.
You, you and you, you come with me.
I need you plugged in, checking Gordon's men and their families.
Will you be wanting the Batpod?
In the middle of the day?
Not very subtle.
The Lamborghini, then.
Much more subtle.
Excuse me.
Let me through.
Excuse me.
Okay.
Sir, could you help, please?
I'm gonna find a bus for him.
Sir?
Commissioner, do you really think...
would try to kill this man?
Sir.
Commissioner.
Get the cars around the back!
Go.
Keep rolling, Sam.
I see O'Brien and Richards.
No immediate family member admitted to a Gotham hospital.
Davis, they got space.
Bring him out.
Davis.
I saw Burns and Zachary.
Nothing on them.
And a patrolman I don't know.
Okay, so, what now?
What do we do now?
Where are we going?
Send the information to Gordon.
Get out of here.
Davis.
Ma'am, we're gonna have to move him now.
You okay, son?
Hi.
You know...
any hard feelings between us, Harvey.
Rachel were being abducted...
I didn't rig those charges.
Your men, your plan.
Do I really look like a guy with a plan?
You know what I am?
I'm a dog chasing cars.
I wouldn't know what to do with one if I caught it.
You know?
I just do things.
The Mob has plans.
The cops have plans.
Gordon's got plans.
You know, they're schemers.
Schemers trying to control their little worlds.
I'm not a schemer.
I try to show the schemers...
to control things really are.
So when I say- -  Ah.
Come here.
When I say that you and your girlfriend was nothing personal...
Why?
Because my wife's in the hospital?
Yeah, that'd be why.
It's the schemers that put you where you are.
You were a schemer, you had plans...
Police are taking every precaution...
take matters into their hands.
I just did what I do best.
I took your little plan and I turned it on itself.
Look what I did to this city with a few drums of gas and a couple of bullets.
Hm?
You know what I noticed?
Nobody panics when things go according to plan. Even if the plan is horrifying.
If tomorrow I tell the press that, like, a gangbanger will get shot...
will be blowing up...
Because it's all part of the plan.
But when I say that one little old mayor will die...
Introduce a little anarchy...
I'm an agent of chaos.
Oh, and you know the thing about chaos?
It's fair.
You die.
Mmm.
Now we're talking.
Mr.
Reese.
That's Mr.
Wayne, isn't it?
Don't you think I should go to the hospital?
Don't watch a whole lot of news, do you, Mr.
Wayne?
Southeast.
It's Gotham General.
You must know how many were inside.
You have patient lists, roll call.
Right now we're showing The other buses were heading off to hospitals.
I guess we missed one.
What's your guess about where Harvey Dent is?
Keep looking.
And keep it to yourself.
Anybody asks, we got him out.
Get me the mayor's office on the line.
We're gonna need the National Guard.
I'm now being told that we're cutting to a video GCN has just received.
I'm Mike Engel for Gotham Tonight.
to make you people wanna join in?
You failed to kill the lawyer.
I've gotta get you off the bench...
Mr.
Fox?
Security is showing a break- in at the R & D Department.
If you don't wanna be in the game...
But the bridge- and- tunnel crowd are sure in for a surprise.
Ha- ha, ha- ha. Shouldn't you be out there, you know, doing something?
It's my day off.
I gotta take a leak.
Keep an eye out for me, will you?
Now what?
Need someone to shake it for you?
Hello.
Dent.
Jesus.
I thought you was dead.
Half.
Who picked up Rachel, Wuertz?
Are you telling me that you're gonna protect the other traitor in Gordon's unit?
I don't know, he never told me.
Listen, Dent, I swear to God, I didn't know what they were gonna do to you.
That's funny...
what's gonna happen to you either.
Beautiful, isn't it?
Beautiful.
Unethical.
Dangerous.
You've turned every cell phone in Gotham into a microphone.
And a high-frequency generator-receiver.
You took my sonar concept and applied it to every phone in the city.
With half the city feeding you sonar, you can image all of Gotham.
This is wrong.
I've gotta find this man, Lucius.
At what cost?
The database is null-key encrypted.
It can only be accessed by one person.
This is too much power for one person.
That's why I gave it to you.
Only you can use it.
Spying on 30 million people isn't part of my job description.
This is an audio sample.
If he talks within range of any phone in the city...
I'll help you this one time.
But consider this my resignation.
As long as this machine is at Wayne Enterprises, I won't be.
When you're finished...
My officers are going over every inch of the tunnels and bridges...
they're not an option.
Which leaves the ferries with 30,000 ready to board.
I wanna use the ferries so I can get those prisoners off the island.
The men you put away?
Those aren't people I'm worried about.
You should be.
Whatever the Joker's planning...
involved.
I wanna get them out of here.
So where is Harvey?
How long can you keep this quiet?
Don't stop for lights, cops, nothing.
Going to join your wife?
You ever imagine what it would be like to listen to her die?
Look, take it up with the Joker.
He killed your woman.
He made you...
The Joker's just a mad dog.
I want whoever let him off the leash.
I took care of Wuertz, but who was your other man inside Gordon's unit?
Who picked up Rachel?
Must have been someone she trusted.
Look, if I tell you...
Can't hurt your chances.
It was Ramirez.
You're a lucky man.
Your driver.
Stand back.
Hey, that ain't right.
We should be on that boat.
You wanna ride across with them?
Be my guest.
Sir, they've stopped their engines.
Right, get on the radio.
Tell them we'll come back and pick them up once we dump the scumbags.
Liberty, this is Spirit.
Come in.
What the heck was that?
What the- - ?
Liberty, come in, please.
This is Spirit.
Come in.
Liberty, we have the same thing.
We've lost both engines.
There's something going on on the ferries.
Get down to the engine room now.
Hey, buddy, what's happening?
Captain, we got a hundred barrels down there rigged to blow.
And this.
Oh, my God.
Looks like some kind of detonator.
Why would they give us the detonator to our own bomb?
Tonight, you're all gonna be a part of a social experiment.
Through the magic of diesel fuel and ammonium nitrate...
to blow you all sky-high.
Liberty, come in, over.
It's dead.
If anyone attempts to get off their boat, you all die.
I'm zeroing in.
Each of you has a remote to blow up the other boat.
His voice is on the ferry...
West.
Prewitt Building.
Assemble on the building opposite.
At midnight, I blow you all up.
If, however, one of you presses the button, I'll let that boat live.
So who's it gonna be?
Harvey Dent's most-wanted scumbag collection...
You choose.
Oh, and you might wanna decide quickly...
may not be quite so noble.
Stay back.
Well, now, who are you to decide?
We ought to talk this over, at least.
We don't all have to die.
Those men had their chance.
They're talking over the same thing on the other boat.
Jim needs you to pack up and put the kids in the car right away.
But the units outside....
Those cops can't be trusted.
Jim needs you away from them as soon as possible.
I'll call them off for 10 minutes, and you'll have to move fast.
She believe you?
It's because she trusts you...
You're the second cop to say that to me.
What exactly did you think they were gonna do?
They got me early on.
My mother's hospital bills....
You live to fight another day, officer.
We found the missing hospital bus.
Then we have a hostage situation.
It's a shooting gallery.
Why would he choose a spot with such big windows?
We have clear shots on five clowns.
Snipers take them out, smash the windows, a team rappels in.
Team moves in by the stairwells.
Two, three casualties max.
the ferries get closer to blowing- - If anyone's got pens, pass it along.
Thank you.
Anybody else?
Coming through.
Anybody else?
Thank you.
We need to get these votes in quickly.
Come on.
What are you waiting for?
Push the button!
We're running out of time!
I need five minutes alone.
No!
There's no time!
We have clear shots!
Dent is in there with them.
We have to save Dent!
I have to save Dent.
Get ready.
Two minutes, then we breach.
Fox, I need picture.
Okay, you got POV on alpha...
Looks like clowns and hostages on two floors.
There's a SWAT team on the stairwell.
Another SWAT team on the roof.
Line's clear.
Blue team, acquire the target.
Entry team, set your charge.
Fox, the SWATs are targeting the wrong people.
he clowns are the hostages.
Red team, go!
Red team, go!
Entry team, blow and go!
Don't move.
Take the shot.
Those SWATs are coming in hot.
Clowns, put down your guns.
Doctors, get down!
Clear the line of fire.
Drop your weap- - Freeze!
Stand down or you will be- - Look up.
See those bad guys on the floor above?
They're waiting to ambush the SWAT team coming up the elevator.
Sixty seconds.
The tally is 140 against, 396 for.
So go ahead.
Do it.
We're still here.
And that means they haven't killed us yet either.
Go, go, go!
Blue team, cover!
Uh- oh.
Trouble on the floor above.
Get down on the ground now!
Freeze!
Stop or we will shoot.
We will shoot you.
Drop the officer.
We got him.
He's out of the game.
Halt!
Be advised.
Clowns are hostages, doctors are targets.
Ah, you made it.
I'm so thrilled.
You don't wanna die...
Give it to me.
These men will kill you and take it anyway.
No one wants to get their hands dirty.
Fine.
I'll do it.
Those men on that boat?
They made their choices.
They chose to murder and steal.
It doesn't make any sense for us to have to die too.
All the old familiar places.
Stand by.
Red team, floor secure.
Hostages are safe.
Give it to me.
You can tell them I took it by force.
Give it to me, and I'll do what you should've did 10 minutes ago.
We really should stop this fighting, otherwise we'll miss the fireworks.
There won't be any fireworks.
And here we go.
What were you trying to prove?
That deep down, everyone's as ugly as you?
You're alone.
Can't rely on anyone these days.
You gotta do everything yourself.
Don't we?
That's okay.
I came prepared.
It's a funny world we live in.
Speaking of which, you know how I got these scars?
No, but I know how you got these.
Oh, you.
You just couldn't let me go, could you?
This is what happens when an unstoppable force...
You truly are incorruptible, aren't you?
Huh?
You won't kill me...
of self-righteousness.
And I won't kill you...
I think you and I are destined to do this forever.
You'll be in a padded cell forever.
Maybe we could share one.
You know, they'll be doubling up, the rate this city's inhabitants are losing their minds.
This city just showed you...
ready to believe in good.
Until their spirit breaks completely.
Until they get a good look at the real Harvey Dent...
You didn't think I'd risk losing the battle for Gotham's soul...
No.
You need an ace in the hole.
Mine's Harvey.
What did you do?
I took Gotham's white knight...
It wasn't hard.
See, madness, as you know...
All it takes is a little push.
Dent!
This is where they brought her, Gordon, after your men handed her over.
This is where she died.
I know, I was here...
If you stood up against corruption...
with the devil.
I was trying to fight the Mob!
You wouldn't dare try to justify yourself if you knew what I'd lost.
Have you ever had to talk to the person you loved most...
when you know it's not?
Well, you're about to know what that feels like, Gordon.
Then you can look me in the eye and tell me you're sorry.
Just the person you love most.
So is it your wife?
Put the gun down, Harvey.
Harvey, put down the gun.
Please.
Please, Harvey.
Please.
Oh, goddamn it.
Will you stop pointing that gun at my family?
No, Jim, stop him!
Harvey.
Don't let him- - Harvey!
I'm sorry!
For everything.
Please don't hurt my son.
You brought your cops?
All they know is there's a situation.
They don't know who or what.
They're just creating a perimeter.
You think I wanna escape from this?
There is no escape from this.
You don't wanna hurt the boy, Harvey.
It's not about what I want, it's about what's fair!
You thought we could be decent men in an indecent time.
But you were wrong.
The world is cruel.
And the only morality in a cruel world...
Unbiased.
Unprejudiced.
Fair.
His son's got the same chance she had.
Fifty- fifty.
What happened to Rachel wasn't chance.
We decided to act.
We three.
Then why was it me who was the only one who lost everything?
Because you were the best of us.
He wanted to prove that even someone as good as you...
And he was right.
You're the one pointing the gun, Harvey.
So point it at the people responsible.
Fair enough.
You first.
My turn.
Harvey, you're right.
Rachel's death was my fault.
Please don't punish the boy.
Tell your boy he's gonna be all right, Gordon.
Lie...
It's going to be all right, son.
Dad?
Daddy, is he okay?
Yes, I do.
The Joker won.
Harvey's prosecution, everything he fought for...
Whatever chance you gave us at fixing our city dies with Harvey's reputation.
We bet it all on him.
The Joker took the best of us and tore him down.
People will lose hope.
They won't.
They must never know what he did.
Five dead.
But the Joker cannot win.
Gotham needs its true hero.
to see yourself become the villain.
I can do those things...
I killed those people.
That's what I can be.
No, no, you can't.
You're not.
I'm whatever Gotham needs me to be.
Call it in.
A hero.
Not the hero we deserved, but the hero we needed.
Nothing less than a knight...
They'll hunt you.
You'll hunt me.
You'll condemn me.
Set the dogs on me.
Because that's what needs to happen.
Because sometimes...
Sometimes people deserve more.
Sometimes people deserve to have their faith rewarded.
Batman.
Batman!
Why's he running, Dad?
Because we have to chase him.
Okay, we're going in!
Go, go!
Move!
He didn't do anything wrong.
Because he's the hero Gotham deserves, but not the one it needs right now.
So we'll hunt him...
Because he's not a hero.
He's a silent guardian...
A dark knight.
